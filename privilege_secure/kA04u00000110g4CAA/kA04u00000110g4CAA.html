In addition, a reboot will occur following any new install or upgrade to V 4.0 or higher.
<ol><li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Following the upgrade and reboot, log into the Netwrix Privilege Secure UI as an administrative user and verify that the services reregister.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Ensure that services are all green under Service Nodes. Refresh if necessary as they update.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Restart the Proxy service (this will also restart dependent services) via services.msc.<br/>	The upgrade is now complete.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li></ol>
<span><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></span>: It is recommended to open each managed domain under Resources and run a test to verify that the service account is correct. This is to ensure that the service account password was unaffected during the upgrade. If this happens, re-enter the service account password and retest to verify operation.</div>
