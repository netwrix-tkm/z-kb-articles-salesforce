<p><span>When upgrading from a pre-4.2.1626 version of Privilege Secure to a post-4.2.1626 version of Privilege Secure, it is possible that the following error occurs:</span></p>
<p><code><span>PostgreSQL is unable to support this locale, please change Windows Regional settings to supported locale. US English is recommended.</span></code></p>
<p><span>This would indicate that an unsupported locale is configured, which creates an issue during the migration from Postgres 12 (pre-4.2.1626) to Postgres 16 (4.2.1626 or higher).</span></p>
<h2 id="instructions"><span>Instructions</span></h2>
<p><span>The Privilege Secure installer executes the <strong>initdb</strong> command as part of the migration to Postgres 16. In order for this command to succeed, the user who is executing <strong>initdb </strong>must have regional settings enabled that correspond to a locale supported by Postgres 16. To resolve this issue, ensure that during upgrade, you are logged in as a user whose locale settings are “English (United States)” (en-US). Then proceed with the upgrade as usual.</span></p></div>
