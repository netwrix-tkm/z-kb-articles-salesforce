This collection of best practices is intended to supplement customers' own security judgement and highlight risks and recommendations.</p>

<div class="table-wrap"><table count-columns="3"><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Best Practice</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Priority</th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Restrict access to the StealthINTERCEPT application server</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">High</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Individuals with administrative access to the StealthINTERCEPT server are implicitly administrators of StealthINTERCEPT and through its capabilities may be able to become administrators on domain controllers. Limit access to the least possible.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Operate StealthINTERCEPT at the same security level as you operate domain controllers</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">High</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">This one principle should guide decisions made about the management and operation of StealthINTERCEPT. Because StealthINTERCEPT protects domain controllers, its implementation should be as protected as they are. Consider deploying StealthINTERCEPT within the same credential boundary as domain controllers to limit the potential for privilege escalation.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Protect StealthINTERCEPT's SQL Server operating system and databases</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">High</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">StealthNTERCEPT's SQL Server database contains sensitive configuration data. The same controls applied to the StealthINTERCEPT server should be applied to the SQL server as well.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Use the Protected Users group to secure accounts that login to the StealthINTERCEPT server</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Adding users to the Protected Users group in active directory automatically protects the account by forcing it to only use secure authentication techniques</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Periodically review StealthINTERCEPT console permissions</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Periodically review holders of the StealthINTERCEPT Administrators and Console Operators roles to ensure only authorized individuals hold those roles.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Protect, randomize, and periodically rotate Windows local administrator account passwords</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Local administrator credentials are frequently targeted by attackers, whether through password guessing or pass-the-hash attacks. Ensure these credentials are randomized, stored securely, and periodically changed using a solution like Microsoft LAPS.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ensure Microsoft security updates are applied to the StealthINTERCEPT server</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Rapidly applying Windows security updates is essential to protecting the StealthINTERCEPT server from the exploitation of known vulnerabilities.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Install and regularly update antivirus and endpoint protection products</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Antivirus and endpoint detection and response solutions help protect servers and applications from malware and adversarial techniques. Install your standard solutions and ensure they are regularly updated.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Install only required applications on the StealthINTERCEPT server</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Installing unnecessary software on the StealthINTERCEPT server increases its attack surface and the amount of threats that must be defended against. Only install absolutely necessary software.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ensure only server administrators can access the StealthINTERCEPT installation directory</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">By default, StealthINTERCEPT uses the permissions granted to program files which only allows SYSTEM, Administrators and, when windows authentication is used, the service account will be applied directly with full control and other accounts. Granting additional privileges creates additional risks to StealthINTERCEPT and should be avoided.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Use a Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution to protect administrative access to StealthINTERCEPT</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Medium</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">A PAM solution allows administrators to securely connect to StealthINTERCEPT and can provide an audit trail for activities taken on the server and within the product.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Ensure Network Level Authentication (NLA) is enabled on the StealthINTERCEPT server</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Low</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1">Network Level Authentication improves the security of the Remote Desktop Protocol connection used to administer the StealthINTERCEPT server.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
