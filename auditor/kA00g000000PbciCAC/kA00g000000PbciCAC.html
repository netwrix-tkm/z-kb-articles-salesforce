        <h2 id="symptom">Symptom</h2>

        <p>
          You have encountered a situation where an account is getting locked out from multiple
          failed logons. Reports show that this account is in fact performing failed logons,
          however, the events from which Netwrix Auditor has parsed do not provide what is causing
          the logon events on the workstation.
        </p>

        <h2 id="cause">Cause</h2>

        <p>
          There are several root causes for this scenario, but most commonly there are services or
          applications that are running via the locked out account. The stored credentials become
          expired and when the service or application attempts to authenticate via the account, it
          performs a failed logon.
        </p>

        <h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>

        <p>
          If further investigation is needed, the XML query below can be executed against the
          Security Event Logs of systems that you suspect the account to being performing failed
          logons.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to populate the Security Log with logon/logoff details, you will need to enable
          logon/logoff auditing via local policy. The Security Log will now provide additional logon
          activity details.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next, navigate to the Windows Event Viewer and open the Security Log. Filter the log, as
          seen here.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Enter the following query into the XML tab</strong></p>

        <pre class="wp-block-verse">&lt;QueryList&gt;
&lt;Query Id="0" Path="Security"&gt;
&lt;Select Path="Security"&gt;*[System[(EventID=4625 or EventID=4776 or EventID=4777 or EventID=4624 or EventID=4634 or EventID=4740 or EventID=4767 or EventID=4768 or EventID=4769 or EventID=4779) and TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) &amp;lt;= 43200000]]] and 
*[EventData[Data[@Name ='TargetUserName'] ='<i><b>ACCOUNT_IN_QUESTION</b></i>']]&lt;/Select&gt;
&lt;/Query&gt;
&lt;/QueryList&gt;</pre>

        <p>
          You will need to replace the <i><b>ACCOUNT_IN_QUESTION </b></i>of the query to the name of
          the account that caused failed logon.<br />Alternatively, if you want to only see auth
          requests and failed logon attempts, use this query:
        </p>

        <pre>&lt;QueryList&gt; 
&lt;Query Id="0" Path="Security"&gt; 
&lt;Select Path="Security"&gt;*[System[(EventID=4625 or EventID=4776 or EventID=4777 or EventID=4624 or EventID=4740 or EventID=4768 or EventID=4769) and TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) &amp;lt;= 43200000]]] and 
*[EventData[Data[@Name ='TargetUserName'] ='<i><b>ACCOUNT_IN_QUESTION</b></i>']]&lt;/Select&gt; 
&lt;/Query&gt; 
&lt;/QueryList&gt;</pre>

        <p>
          You can also remove or expand the time frame by manipulating the
          <strong>TimeCreated[timediff(@SystemTime) &lt;= 43200000]</strong> element of the query.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Last Hour = 3600000</li>
          <li>Last 12 Hours = 43200000</li>
          <li>Last 24 Hours = 86400000</li>
          <li>Last 7 days = 604800000</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="investigating_recurring_failed_logons">Investigating Recurring Failed Logons</h4>
        The most common scenario for failed logons is when some service or application is running
        using wrong credentials. To find the exact program or see more details for the logon event,
        please follow the instructions below:

        <ol>
          <li>
            Run Netwrix Auditor –&gt; Search, and specify the filters:<br />
            <b>Data Source – Equals – Logon Activity </b><br />
            <b>Action – Equals – Failed logon</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            Find the event, and locate the workstation where the failed logon occurred. (details –
            originating workstation)
          </li>
          <li>
            Navigate to the workstation where the failed logon occurred and enable local audit
            policy settings:<br />
            <i
              ><b
                >gpedit.msc -&gt; Computer Configurations -&gt; Windows Settings -&gt; Security
                Settings -&gt; Local Policies -&gt; Audit Policy</b
              ></i
            ><br />
            <b>-Audit process tracking: Success, Failure</b><br />
            <b>-Audit Logon events: Success, Failure</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            Right-click <b>Start &gt; Event Viewer &gt;Windows&gt;Security event log.</b><br />
            Now we need to wait for new failed logons for the account, and filter security event log
            by event ID 4625.
          </li>
          <li>
            Find the event we are looking for (you can click ctrl+f and enter the problematic
            account name).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <b>NOTE</b>: The username in events can be indicated in different formats, for example,
        domain\user, user@domain.com, or simply user in general. You can search for the unique part
        of the username, the [user] part in domain\user.<br /><br />In the Caller Process Name you
        can see the name of the program which is using wrong credentials.<br /><br />For example:<br />Caller
        Process Name: C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSRS13.SQLEXPRESS\Reporting
        Services\ReportServer\bin\ReportingServicesService.exe<br />In such case you can open SQL
        Server Reporting Services Configuration Manager and change the credentials for user there.
        Also you can check if you have old SSRS instances on this server.<br /><br />Update the
        password for the problematic service and disable audit policies that have been enabled in
        step 3 after the investigation.
        <h4 id="investigating_failed_logons_from_outside_of_domain_using_netlogon_debugging">
          Investigating Failed Logons from Outside of Domain using Netlogon Debugging
        </h4>
        Sometimes failed logons occur when users from outside of Domain try to logon onto your
        servers. This can be detected by Netwrix Auditor when there is no domain name in the WHO
        field (neither domain\username nor username@doman style). This means that there is an
        attempt to logon using NTLM.<br /> 
        <p><strong>Step 1: Find your logon server</strong></p>
        First, check which server is your domain’s logon server by typing “<b>set logonserver</b>”
        in CMD

        <p><strong>Step 2: Look at Event Viewer</strong></p>
        Log into that server and open Event Viewer, or open Event viewer and choose
        <b>Action &gt; Connect to another Computer</b><br />Look in the Security log files, and if
        you see “<b>Audit failure</b>” with “<b>logon type=3</b>” that means there are Network
        “Netlogon” failure attempts.

        <p><strong>Step 3: Enable NetLogon logging</strong></p>
        Enable NetLogon Logging: Use the following command on the logon server in a command prompt:

        <pre>nltest /dbflag:0x2080ffff</pre>
        The netlogon.log file is located in the <b>%SystemRoot%\Debug</b> directory of the Microsoft
        Windows Logon Server.

        <p><strong>Step 4: Identify the source of the attack</strong></p>
        In the <b>netlogon.log </b>file, you can find which entries correspond to your failed logon
        attempts and this will also show you what the hostname is that the attempt is coming
        from.<br />If an internal attack, the workstation name is likely part of your domain/network
        already.<br />If an outside attack, the hostname can be anything, even the name of a brute
        force program such as FreeRDP - in some cases, it may even be blank.
        <p><strong>Step 5: Disable NetLogon logging</strong></p>
        When finished, and you have found examples of your impacted username being attempted,
        disable NetLogon Logging with this command:

        <pre>nltest /dbflag:0x0</pre>
        You don't want to keep NetLogon enabled simply because it will use resources and disk space
        on your system when it is not actively needed.

        <p><strong>Step 6: Identify Reason Codes/Error Codes</strong></p>
        See code translations:<br /><a

        ><br />2 Common codes you may see in the log file: 0XC000006A – An incorrect password was
        guessed 0XC0000234 – An account lockout was issued from the “Via” computer name - this is
        the computer which is being attempted against, and which sends the lockout signal to your
        domain controller (or local policy holder if in a workgroup).<br />If you want an overview
