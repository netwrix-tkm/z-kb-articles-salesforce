            This article provides preparation steps for upgrading an operating system (Windows) in
            the Netwrix Auditor host server.

          Pre-Upgrade Data Security Measures: Snapshot and Backup Guidelines
        </h4>

        <div>
          <p>
            Taking a snapshot or creating a backup of the Netwrix Auditor Server is recommended for
            data protection and recovery. The method to be used depends on the approach used for
            Auditor installation, whether it's on a virtual or physical machine.
          </p>
        </div>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>TIP:</strong> You can configure Auditor in the failover mode. To learn about
            failover and backup scenarios, read

        <p>
          Stop all Netwrix services running in your server âˆ’ run the following line in elevated
          PowerShell:
        </p>

        <pre
          class="has-inner-focus"
        ><code class="lang-Registry">Stop-Service -Displayname Netwrix*</code></pre>

          Post-Upgrade Procedure: Auditor Initialization and Service Verification
        </h4>

        <div>
          <p>
            After the upgrade, give a couple of hours to Auditor to initialize, and make sure all
            services are running. To start all Auditor-related processes in the server, run the
            following line in elevated PowerShell:
          </p>

          <pre
            class="has-inner-focus"
          ><code class="lang-Registry">Start-Service -Displayname Netwrix*</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h4 id="post-upgrade_warnings_and_data_collection_interruptions">
          Post-Upgrade Warnings and Data Collection Interruptions
        </h4>

        <div>
          <p>
            After the upgrade, you might notice warnings in the Health log. These warnings occur
            because services are temporarily unavailable and data collection is interrupted during
            the upgrade and server reboot. Once the upgrade is complete, services will be
            automatically restarted, and data collection will continue without any issues.
