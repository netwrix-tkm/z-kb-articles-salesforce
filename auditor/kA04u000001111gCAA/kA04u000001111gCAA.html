            Your report states some accounts were not moved or deleted. Why were they not affected?

            Since IUT has the ability to make actual changes within your Active Directory, it has
            requirements to meet to introduce these changes. IUT requires all DCs to be operating,
            otherwise it cannot verify that a user is truly inactive. In case there are non-operable
            or decommissioned domain controllers in your network, you can omit them — refer to the
            following article for additional information:

            If you still encounter reports showing the <code>Cannot delete the account</code> status
            for accounts after omitting the inoperable DCs, refer to the following steps:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                This error might appear if the targeted computer account is not an end object but a
                container for other objects. IUT won't be able to remove those accounts unless the
                <strong>Delete account with all its subnodes</strong> checkbox is checked.
              </p>

                The data collection account used by IUT does not have sufficient rights and
                permissions. Refer to the following article for additional information on roles,
                rights, and permissions required for Inactive User Tracker data collection account:

                The account has the
                <strong>Protect object from accidental deletion</strong> checkbox checked in
                <strong>Properties</strong> &gt; <strong>Object</strong>. This is a Windows Active
                Directory feature to prevent the deletion and moving of flagged objects without
                admin intervention. IUT cannot override this feature, it is required to manually
                edit the flag.
