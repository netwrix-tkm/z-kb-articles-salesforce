          <p>
            Netwrix Auditor takes up a lot of disk space and once it gets to around a minimum of
            free disk space, the Netwrix services stop, and all monitoring plans have the
            <b>Stops Responding</b> status. Which are Netwrix recommendations for adequate hardware
            resource consumption?
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

        <div>
          <p>The following recommendations will allow you to reduce disk space consumption:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Netwrix recommends upgrading to the latest version. For each updated version,
                Netwrix improves performance and tends avoiding disk space consumption.
              </p>

              <p>
                For additional information on upgrade procedure, refer to the following article: <a
                  href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/Auditor_10.6/page/Content/Auditor/Install/Upgrade.htm"
                  target="_blank"
                  >Installation — Upgrade to the Latest Version — v10.6</a
                >.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Move your Long-Term Archive to another logical disk and/or modify its retention
                settings. <b>Long-Term Archive</b> is a file-based storage where Netwrix Auditor
                saves the collected activity records.
              </p>

              <p>
                By default, it is located on the system drive at
                <em>%PROGRAMDATA%\Netwrix Auditor\Data</em> and keeps data for
                <b>120 months (10 years)</b> and the product informs you if you are running out of
                space on a system disk where it is stored.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once the free disk space starts approaching the minimum level, you will see events
                in the <b>Netwrix Auditor System Health</b> log. When the free disk space is less
                than <b>3GB</b>, the Netwrix services responsible for audit data collection will be
                stopped, which means that the data collection also stops.
              </p>

              <p>Migrate Working Folder to a new location.</p>

              <p>
                The size of your Working Folder may grow significantly (normally, up to 10 – 20GB)
                depending on the workload, especially during activity peaks. If your system drive
                capacity is limited, you might want to keep the temporary files and trace logs on
                another drive, i.e. change the Working Folder default location.
              </p>

              <p>
                For additional information on how to move the Working Folder, refer to the following

                Remove the <b>Netwrix Backup</b> folder. Netwrix strongly recommends keeping the
                backups for supported product versions.

                Additional space might be consumed by the <b>Local DB</b> in the
                <b>ShortTerm</b> folder; this can occur when the SQL communication is not working
                properly or the DB files getting corrupted. Follow the resolution steps in the
                article:

                Check the size of the Windows page file. If it grows big, this indicates lack of RAM
                and Windows tries to compensate it with disk space. Adding more RAM helps fixing
                disk space consumption by page files.
              </p>

              <p>Follow the steps to inspect page file usage using <b>Performance Monitor</b></p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    On the Auditor Server, open <b>Administrative Tools</b> -&gt;
                    <b>Performance Monitor</b>.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Expand <b>Monitoring Tools</b> and select <b>Performance Monitor</b>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Right-click the graph and select <b>Add Counters...</b>.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>In the <b>Available counters</b> list, select <b>Paging File.</b></p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Click the down-arrow icon to the right of Paging File.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Select <em>% Usage</em> under Paging File and then click the <b>Add</b> button.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>Click <b>OK</b> to close the dialog.</p>
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                Now the <b>Paging File</b> counter is displayed in the <b>Performance Monitor</b>.
