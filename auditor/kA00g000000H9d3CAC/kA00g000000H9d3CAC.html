          <p>The Netwrix Auditor System Health Log contains the following error message:</p>
          <pre>
Event ID: 1206 
Netwrix Auditor for SharePoint Core Service cannot be found</pre

        </div>
        <h2 id="causes">Causes</h2>
        <div>
          <p>This can be due to one of the following reasons:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The manual Core Service installation mode was selected when the monitoring plan was
                created, and the Netwrix Auditor for SharePoint Core Service cannot be found on the
                computer where SharePoint Central Administration is installed.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The manual Core Service installation mode was selected when the monitoring plan was
                created, but the wrong SharePoint Central Administration URL was specified.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                If the manual installation mode was used, check that you have specified a valid
                SharePoint Central Administration URL.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Install the Netwrix Auditor for SharePoint Core Service manually. For detailed
                instructions, refer to the following article: <a

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <strong>TIP:</strong> After the successful manual installation, the error will persist
              until the next scheduled data collection. To start the collection manually, navigate
              to a SharePoint monitoring plan, select <strong>Edit</strong> and click
              <strong>Update</strong> on the right pane.
