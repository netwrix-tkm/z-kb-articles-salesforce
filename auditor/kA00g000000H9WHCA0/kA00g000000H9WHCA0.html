        How are collections handled after a network outage on the Netwrix server or when Domain
        Controllers are offline for some time?
        <hr />
        Active Directory data collections run every minute. At the end of each collection the
        product saves the position of the last collected event and starts the next collection from
        the same place. Assuming that the Domain Controller's security log is not overwritten while
        the server is inaccessible, the data will be collected and processed as soon as the server
        is turned back on or network connectivity is restored and no data loss will happen.<br />Note
        that Security Log events are not required for determining most of the changes - they are
        mostly used as the source of When and Who information. If the Security log overwrites while
        the DC is inaccessible, or the disconnect time exceeds 6 hours, the product may report some
        changes with "System" in the 'Who Changed' field. At the same time a warning will be logged
        informing that the event log overwrites occurred.
