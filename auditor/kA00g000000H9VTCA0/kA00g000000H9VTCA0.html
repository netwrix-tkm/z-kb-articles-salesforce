        If access to the Internet on Netwrix server is denied you may see some Netwrix files are
        trying to connect to IP addresses outside of your organization using HTTP protocol.<br /> <br />This
        is caused by Code signing verification.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_signing" target="_blank">Code signing</a> is the
        process of digitally signing executables and scripts to confirm the software author and
        guarantee that the code has not been altered or corrupted since it was signed. The process
        employs the use of a cryptographic hash to validate authenticity and integrity. Code signing
        is used on Windows and Mac OS X to authenticate software on first run, ensuring that the
        software has not been maliciously tampered with by a third-party distributor or download
        site.<br />The public key used to authenticate the code signature should be traceable back
        to a trusted root authority CA, preferably using a secure public key infrastructure
        (PKI).<br /> <br />Netwrix files are signed using a certificate that was issued by Symantec
        Class 3 SHA256 Code Signing CA. Symantec has sold their Certificates Authority business to
        <a href="https://www.digicert.com/code-signing/" target="_blank">DigiCert</a>. DigiCert root
        certificates are usually added to Trusted Root Certification Authorities certificate store
        in latest versions of Windows Server and Windows Desktop operating systems.<br /> <br />Being
        that it’s not the executable itself connects to eternal IP to verify the signature, it’s
        operating system doing that on behalf of an EXE.<br /> <br />Since different companies are
        using different ISPs the route to the trusted CA can be different. Thus the IP addresses an
        EXE is trying to access to verify signature can also differ.<br /> <br />If you want
        attempts to connect to external IPs to stop you may need to temporary allow internet access
        on the Netwrix Server so the certificates will be verified and added to trusted CA store on
        the server. Disabling the Code signing verification is a huge security risk, we do not
        recommend to do that.<br /> <br />Unless you have policy that restricts executing of
        unverified files enabled, inability to verify files certificates does not cause any problems
        with collecting the data by Netwrix Auditor
