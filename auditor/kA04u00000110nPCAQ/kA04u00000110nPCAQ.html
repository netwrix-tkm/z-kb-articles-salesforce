          <p>
            My Security Event and Incident Management suite has detected Mimikatz Pass-the-Hash
            activity on Netwrix Auditor server. Is Netwrix Auditor trying to steal my passwords and
            hashes?
          </p>
        </div>

          <p>
            This is an expected behavior for the set up Active Directory monitoring plan. Netwrix
            Auditor collects data from audited domains with the Data Collection account via
            impersonation. Refer to the following link for additional information on impersonation:

              target="_blank"
              >Impersonation</a
            >. The use of impersonation requires Secondary Logon Service enabled as stated in the
            product documentation:
            <a
              href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/Auditor_10.5/page/Content/Auditor/Configuration/ActiveDirectory/SecondaryLogonService.htm"
              target="_self"
              >Enable Secondary Logon Service</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can exclude your Netwrix Auditor server from the monitoring scope of your SEIM to
            stop receiving these alerts. For additional information on the Pass-the-Hash attack,
            refer to the following article:
