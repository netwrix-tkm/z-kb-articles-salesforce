        provided by sales tells you to go to Settings -&gt; Licenses in the Management Console.
        However, the licenses node is not there.

        <hr />

        If the only product(s) you use are one or both of the above then most likely you are running
        an old version of the console.

        <hr />

        It is not necessary to upgrade your console to get this node as no functionality of a newer
        console is utilized by these two products. The alternative method of adding these licenses
        is to: 1) Open the <strong>Management Console</strong> 2) Expand the proper
        <strong>Managed Object</strong> you have created for these two products. 3)
        <strong>Right click</strong> the <strong>Password Expiration Notifier</strong> or
        <strong>Inactive User Tracker</strong> nodes and go to About 4) From here you will click the
        <strong>Change License</strong> button and enter your license accordingly using the
        <strong>copy/paste</strong> method to ensure no errors in entering.
