        How to exclude files, folders or shares from auditing by Netwrix Auditor for File Servers?

        <hr />

        If you do not want to audit every folder and/or file defined on the file server's shares or
        are monitoring the whole server but want to omit a specific share, you can omit them using
        the a special omit file. 1. Navigate to the product installation folder via Windows Explorer
        (by default: C:Program Files (x86)NetwrixFile Server Change Reporter) 2. Open
        <b>omitcollectlist.txt</b> file (<b>omitpathlist.txt</b> in 6.0 or older) in any text editor
        3. Add the paths you do not want to be audited. For example: File Exclusion:
        \servershare_folderfilename All Files in a Folder Exclusion: \servershare_folder* All
        Folders in a share: \servershare* 4. Save modifications made to the file. Note: The above
        changes will not take effect until the next data collection. Also this will only omit
        changes/reads made on those files/folders that are excluded. It will not omit warnings/error
        related to those files/folders such as access denied.
