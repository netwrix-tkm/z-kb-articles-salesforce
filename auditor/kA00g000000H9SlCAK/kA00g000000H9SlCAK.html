        <div>
          <p>
            Why was a Service Principle Name attribute change reported as made by System or a user
            account?
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

          <p>
            A Kerberos Service Principle Name attribute allows a service on a specific server to be
            associated with an account responsible for management of the service. Once associated, a
            mutual Kerberos authentication is permitted. Changes to this attribute are usually made
            by System in response to the operating system changes on a specific computer, e.g.
            installation of operating system updates, name changes, installation of SQL Server,
            etc.<br />The WHO field for changes related to the Service Principle Name attribute may
            contain the following:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Made by a computer account with $ prefix (<strong>DOMAINXVISIO$</strong>) — the
                Service Principle Name attribute was changed by a local system service of the
                computer.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Made by a domain controller account with $ prefix (<strong>DOMAINXPTDC$</strong>) —
                the Service Principle Name attribute was changed by a local system service on the
                domain controller.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Made by the <strong>System</strong> account — the Service Principle Name attribute
                was changed by Active Directory represented by System in response to the operating
                system changes on computer, but the corresponding security event wasn't generated
                for this system change.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Made by an actual user account — the Service Principle Name attribute was modified
                manually.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Since the Service Principle Name attribute is changed only for system purpose, you can
            exclude this attribute from the monitoring scope:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                In %Netwrix Auditor installation folder%\Active Directory Auditing, add the
                following line to the omitproplist.txt file:
              </p>

              <pre class="has-inner-focus">*.ServicePrincipleName</pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>In the same folder, remove the following line from the unomitproplist.txt file:</p>

              <pre class="has-inner-focus">*.ServicePrincipleName</pre>
            </li>
          </ul>
