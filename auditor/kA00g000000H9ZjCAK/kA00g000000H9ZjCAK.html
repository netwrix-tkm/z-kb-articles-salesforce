        Review the possible causes of this issue:
        <ol>
          <li>The database was not created and does not exist on the monitored server.</li>
          <li>
            The default Data Processing Account used to collect data from the monitored SQL Servers
            was changed.
          </li>
          <li>The database is in the recovery mode.</li>
          <li>
            The account, which is assigned the database owner role of the monitored database, has no
            access to the<strong> NetwrixSQLCRAudit</strong> database.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <hr />

        Depending on the issue cause, try one of the following solutions:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Check if the <strong>NetwrixSQLCRAudit</strong> database exists on the monitored server.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure that the account under which Netwrix Auditor is running has enough privileges
            on the SQL Server. Make sure it is assigned the <strong>db_owner</strong> role.
          </li>
          <li>
            Grant all <strong>db_owners</strong> of the monitored databases rights to write into the
            <strong>NetWrixSQLCRAudit</strong> database. Alternatively, replace all
            <strong>db_owner</strong> accounts with the account under which Netwrix Auditor runs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <div>
              In SQL Server Management Studio, right-click the monitored database and select
              <strong>Properties </strong>navigate to the <strong>Options </strong>tab. Make sure
              that the <strong>Compatibility level</strong> is set to the SQL Server version that is
              currently running.
