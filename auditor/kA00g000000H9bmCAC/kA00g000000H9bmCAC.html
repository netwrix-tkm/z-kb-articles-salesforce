        Account Lockout Examiner(ALE) does not work through remote control with Exchange server.
        Remote control is configured to use Exchange. Notifications are sent without issues, but
        replying to them does not unlock accounts.

        <hr />

        This usually happens when Remote Control is configured incorrectly.
