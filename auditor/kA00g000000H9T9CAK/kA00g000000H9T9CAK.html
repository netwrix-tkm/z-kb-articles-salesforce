        This error means that there are mapped drives in the system, but NetWrix Account Lockout
        Examiner for some reason cannot read the information on the credentials used to map drives
        in the Windows registry of the examined machine. This error usually occurs when the user
        under whose account a drive is mapped, used their own credentials, or a drive is mapped each
        time a user logs on with the current crendeitals.
