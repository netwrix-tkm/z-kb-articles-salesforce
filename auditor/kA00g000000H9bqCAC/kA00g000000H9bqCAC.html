        The following error appears in the Event Log Manager (ELM) - Summary Report: ERROR: Failed
        to open log "Log Type" (API used: NT). Error details: The network path was not found. (Error
        number: 0x80070035)

        <hr />

        This error usually appears when ELM is configured to collect event logs without agent
        services (i.e. network traffic compression option is turned off). There are several possible
        reasons for this error to appear:
        <ol>
          <li>The problematic server is turned off or not accessible through the network.</li>
          <li>The "Server" service is stopped on the problematic server.</li>
          <li>
            The "File &amp; Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks" feature is turned off in the
            Local Area Connection properties.
          </li>
          <li>The remote connection is blocked by "Windows Firewall".</li>
        </ol>

        <hr />

        <ol>
          <li>
            Make sure the problematic server is started and is accessible through the network.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure the "Server" service is started and set to "Automatic" on the problematic
            server.
          </li>
