          While each data source has different monitoring plan configuration options, there are some
          commonalities across them all. This article will assist you in learning the fundamental
          layouts of a Monitoring Plan and details on specific configurations.
        </p>

        <h2 id="monitoring_plan_layout">Monitoring Plan Layout</h2>

        <p>
          Navigate to any of your configured monitored plans. In the upper right most pane of the
          Monitoring Plan, you will find the <em>Monitoring Plan</em> configuration options. The
          options available here apply global to any data source and item listed under the
          monitoring plan. <em>Edit Settings</em> provides you with the following menu options
        </p>

        <h3 id="monitoring_plan_options">Monitoring Plan Options</h3>

          alt=""
        />

        <h4 id="edit_settings">Edit Settings</h4>

        <p>
          <strong>General – </strong>Here you can rename and provide descriptions for your
          Monitoring Plan
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Data Collection – </strong>Here you can change or modify the account used to
          collect data from audited data sources under this Monitoring Plan
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Audit Database – </strong>Here you are given the option to disable search
          functionality if you only wish to receive activity summaries (We do not recommend this
          option). You may also choose to rename the database in which audit data all data source
          and items under this monitoring plan is written. <strong>Note: </strong>If you change the
          name in this text field, it deploys a new database. The previous database will remain in
          SQL but the content within it is no longer available for searching in reporting. Only
          databases specified in the Audit Database tab of monitoring plans can be searched and
          reported on. Lastly, you may choose to specify a custom account to write this audit data
          to the audit database in your SQL Server.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Notifications – </strong>This menu provides the options to modify the notification
          schedule. By default, the activity summary will be sent daily at 3:00 AM. What is less
          obvious about this function is that it is tied to the State in Time collection schedule
          for your data sources. With the default configuration, as listed above, we will run a
          State in Time collection at 3:00 AM. We recommend leaving the schedule at default.
          Increasing frequency results in more State in Time snapshots which can lead to more
          storage consumption and resource performance issues. Changing the time, however, can be
          useful in situations where many processes are occurring at the same time. Changing the
          time from 3:00 AM to 4:00 AM should not have a negative impact as long as you leave the
          frequency at 24 hours.
        </p>

        <h4 id="delegation">Delegation</h4>

        <p>
          Delegation allows administrators to provide Role-Based Access to Monitoring Plans and
          specific data. If you would like to learn more about Delegation, visit our
          <a
            href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/Roles/Role_Based_Access.html?Highlight=delegation"
            target="_blank"
            >Help Center</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h4 id="update">Update</h4>

        <p>
          Following the <em>Delegation</em> option, you will see the <em>Update</em> button. This
          button allows you to force a collection for every data source and item under the
          Monitoring Plan. There are some Data Sources that behave differently with this button. For
          example, User Activity cannot perform a forced collection. There is another exception for
          the <em>Update</em> button.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>We do not recommend performing an update on an Active Directory Data Source.</em> Due
          to its design, clicking update may prevent the collector from finishing the combination of
          event data with state in time data. This often results in Activity Records with incomplete
          timestamps and Who as <em>System</em>. In this case, it is better to wait for the Active
          Directory collector to finish, which occurs roughly every 10 minutes.
        </p>

        <h3 id="data_source_options">Data Source Options</h3>

        <img
          class="wp-image-5668"
          src="https://kb.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Data-Source-settings-1024x323.png"
          alt=""
        />

        <p>
          <strong>Add Data Source - </strong>Under the Data Source options, we can add a new data
          source. While this option is available, we only recommended combining Active Directory,
          Exchange, and Group Policy. Due to the current configuration of globally locked settings,
          combining Active Directory with something like File Server auditing, can often lead to
          issues. Keep data sources separated also makes for more efficiently troubleshooting.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Edit Data Source</strong></p>

        <p>
          This menu will be greatly different from one data source to another. The only constants
          you may find here are
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Enabling/Disabling State in Time – Recommended to be enabled</li>
          <li>
            Enabling/Disabling Network Traffic Compression - Recommended to be enabled
            <ul>
              <li>
                When enabled, more processing is done at the target server. When disabled, more data
                is sent over the network and processes locally on the Netwrix Auditor host.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>
                If notice performance issues, you could turn this option on or off to trial
                performance.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          All other configurations for a data source will heavily depend on the data source. We
          recommend visiting our
          <a
            href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/Configure_IT_Infrastructure/Configure_IT-Infrastructure.html"
            target="_blank"

        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Remove Data Source ­– </strong>Highlighting a data source and selected this option
          will remove it from the Monitoring Plan. The audit database for this monitoring plan will
          still contain audit data for this data source but will no longer collect and store further
          information after the data source is removed.
        </p>

        <h3 id="item_options">Item Options</h3>

        <img
          class="wp-image-5669"
          src="https://kb.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Item-Settings-1024x323.png"
          alt=""
        />

        <p>
          <strong>Add Item – </strong>Highlighting a data source and selecting
          <em>Add Item</em> will allow you to add another support item for that data source. For
          Active Directory, you could add another Domain. For User Activity, you could add another
          workstation or server. When it comes to the number of items you should audit under one
          Monitoring Plan, it comes down to available resources. We highly recommended starting
          small and working up from there. For example, through trial and error, an administrator
          finds that their Netwrix Auditor host can handle 5 Windows Server per Windows Server
          Monitoring Plan. They have 30 servers that need to be audited. They then decided to deploy
          6 Windows Server Monitoring Plans to accommodate this.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Edit Item – </strong>This allows you to modify or change the audited item. For
          more granularity, you can also use <em>Edit Item</em> to provide custom credentials. This
          is useful for audited DMZ’s or secured file systems for which you wish to use a more
          locked down account. Custom credentials will override the credentials provided under
          <em>Edit Settings &gt; Data Collection</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Remove Item</strong> – This will remove the item from the data source and
          monitoring plan. If the target server has an agent, Netwrix Auditor will attempt to remove
          it. If it fails, you may need to do so manually through <em>Programs and Features.</em>
        </p>

        <h3 id="the_perfect_monitoring_plan"><strong>The Perfect Monitoring Plan</strong></h3>

        <p>Ideally, a monitoring plan should exhibit these elements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Segregated Data Sources</li>
          <li>State in Time Enabled</li>
          <li>Load Balanced Scope (Number of Items)</li>
          <li>Careful consideration of Data Source specific configurations</li>
        </ul>
