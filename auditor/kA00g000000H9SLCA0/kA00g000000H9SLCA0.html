        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            The Network Traffic Compression Service is realized by a tiny executable file that runs
            on Domain Controllers, collects and pre-filter data and then sends it to the Netwrix
            Auditor in a highly compressed format.
          </p>
        </div>

        <blockquote>
          <div>
            <span><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></span> if you do not want any extra services running
            on the Domain Controllers, you can configure Netwrix Auditor to work without the service
            (<strong>not recommended</strong>)
          </div>
        </blockquote>

        <div>
          <p>
            The Traffic Compression Service can help increase scalability and optimize traffic.
            Being a recommended option generally, it is also extremely useful in poorly connected
            environments – if you have multiple Domain Controllers distributed among several
            geographic locations.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Network Traffic Compression creates a service on the DC and copies a folder of 6KB
            in size to the machine. The service only runs when the Netwrix Auditor server calls it.
            In congested systems with a high latency the service can substantially improve data
            transfer, minimizing the impact on bandwidth. Using the service results in an
            approximately 100x reduction in the amount of data transferred and has a negligible
            impact on the performance of the target computer.

            <strong>TIP:</strong> network traffic compression can be enabled for all DCs in the
            domain by selecting a corresponding option in the Active Directory data source
          </div>
        </blockquote>

        <div>
          <p>To override the default value for the particular DCs you specify:</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Navigate to the Netwrix Auditor installation directory. For example,
                <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Netwrix Auditor\Active Directory Auditing</code>
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Open <strong>agent.ini</strong></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Update it using the syntax below:</p>

              <pre>dcname={remote|agent|skip|skipSilent}</pre>

              <p><strong>Parameters</strong></p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>dcname</strong> – name of a domain controller for which you want to
                    customize the Network Traffic Compression Service usage
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>remote</strong> – means that the service will NOT be used on this
                    particular domain controller
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>agent</strong> – means that the service will be used to collect data
                    from this particular domain controller, even if it is disabled in the Netwrix
                    Auditor UI
                  </p>
                </li>

                  <p>
                    <strong>skip</strong> – means that the data will not be collected from this
                    particular domain controller (this option can be used, for example, if the
                    domain controller goes down and should be temporarily excluded from data
                    collection)
                  </p>

                  <blockquote>
                    <div>
                      <span><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> Using the <code>skip</code> setting can
                      produce incomplete reports: incorrect values in <strong>Who Changed</strong> /
                      <strong>When Changed</strong> fields

                  <p>
                    <strong>skipsilent</strong> – same as skip but should only be used for
                    completely decommissioned DCs

        <div>
          <p>
            You have six domain controllers. Five of them are located in New York and one in
            Seattle. You do not need to use agents in the New York domain controllers since they
            have fast network connections while the one located in Seattle is slow due to its
            distance from the main office.
          </p>

          <p>In this way, you can specify the agent monitoring as follows:</p>
        </div>

        <pre>
    NY1.acme.com=remote
    NY2.acme.com=remote
    NY3.acme.com=remote
    NY4.acme.com=remote
    NY5.acme.com=remote
    Seattle.acme.com=agent
</pre
