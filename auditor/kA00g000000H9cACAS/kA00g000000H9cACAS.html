        NetWrix Account Lockout Examiner generates excessive traffic in the network

        <hr />

        NetWrix Account Lockout Examiner gets information from Windows security logs. The product
        connects to domain controllers (DCs) to find lockout events. Then it connects to
        workstations to find detailed information about the invalid logon attempts, which caused the
        lockouts. When the product is configured to monitor all DCs in your domain, it establishes
        connections with all DCs as well as their subject workstations.

        <hr />

        To reduce the bandwidth usage, do the following:
        <ol>
          <li>Run Registry Editor: navigate to Start &gt; Run, type in regedit and click OK.</li>
          <li>
            Navigate to HKLMSoftware[Wow6432Node]NetWrixAccount Lockout Examiner (Wow6432Node only
            for x64 OS).
          </li>
          <li>Set 'readlog' to 0.</li>
          <li>Create a new DWORD value 'UseWatcher' and set its value to 1.</li>
          <li>Set 'UseWMI_Workstations' to 1</li>
          <li>Restart Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner Service via the Services snap-in.</li>
        </ol>
        This will change method of event collection and should reduce bandwidth utilization. There
        is also an option to disable examination of workstations. In this case name of the process
        that cause invalid logon will never be shown.. To disable examination of workstations, do
        the following:
        <ol>
          <li>Run Registry Editor: navigate to Start &gt; Run, type in regedit and click OK.</li>
          <li>
            Navigate to HKLMSoftware[Wow6432Node]NetWrixAccount Lockout Examiner (Wow6432Node only
            for x64 OS).
          </li>
          <li>Create a new DWORD value 'PF_Enabled' and set its value to 0.</li>
          <li>Restart NetWrix Account Lockout Examiner Service via the Services snap-in.</li>
        </ol>
