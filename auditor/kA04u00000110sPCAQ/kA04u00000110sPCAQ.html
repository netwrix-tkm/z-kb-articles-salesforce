            The Netwrix Auditor upgrade process is stuck, should I interrupt it and run it again?

        <div>
          <p>
            Depending on the version you're upgrading from and to, there could be major changes
            implemented in the new Netwrix Auditor build. During the upgrade process Netwrix Auditor
            may configure new permissions and settings directly related to new features introduced.
            It is also recommended to upgrade your Netwrix Auditor instance during non-working hours
            to allow it run for a longer period of time. In some cases, an upgrade may take over 10
            hours to complete.
          </p>

          <p>
            Refer to the following steps in case your upgrade process takes over 20 hours to
            complete:
