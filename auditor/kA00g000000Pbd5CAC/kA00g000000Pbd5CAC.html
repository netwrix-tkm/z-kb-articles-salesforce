        <p>
          When installing NDC there are 12 default Taxonomies that are available out of the box.
          These taxonomies are added to the SQL DB via the installer. In a situation where you have
          created a custom taxonomy, it is important to create a backup. This is because as a loss
          of the SQL DB for any reason will cause you to lose the custom taxonomy and force you to
          recreate it. This will also allow you to move custom taxonomies to multiple NDC instances
          that each have their own SQL DB.
        </p>
