        Can Netwrix Auditor be configured to monitor only specific users in the AD domain and
        Exchange?
        <hr />
        The product has the following ways to exclude Active Directory objects from being audited
        The files are located under the Netwrix Auditor installation path, for example C:\Program
        Files (x86)\Netwrix Auditor\Active Directory Auditing<br />1. Omitpathlist.txt contains a
        list of AD paths to be excluded from reports. For example:
        <ul>
          <li>*\USERS\* omits all objects in the Users OU located anywhere in the AD</li>
          <li>
            *\USERS* omits all objects in the OU which name begins with USERS and the OU itself.
          </li>
          <li>
            *\Sacremento\USERS* would be used if you want to omit users in a very specific OU named
            USERS where you have multiple OUs with the same name in different parent OUs.
          </li>
        </ul>
        2. Allowedpathlist.txt contains a list of AD paths to be included in reports. This file can
        be used, for example, if you only want to monitor specific OU(s) inside your AD domain, but
        not the entire domain. In this case, put a wildcard (*) in omitpathlist.txt file to exclude
        all paths, and then specify the OU(s) you want to monitor in the allowedpathlist.txt
        file.<br />For example: If you add Domain\USERS to omitpathlist.txt list and add
        Domain\USERS\Employees into allowedpathlist.txt, the contents of the Users OU will not be
        audited but the contents of the Employees OU and all its child objects will be monitored.<br />3.
        Omitallowedpathlist.txt contains a list of AD paths to be excluded from reports. This file
        can be used if you want to exclude certain paths inside those specified in the
        allowedpathlist.txt file. In this case, put a wildcard (*) in the omitpathlist.txt file to
        exclude all paths, then specify the OU(s) you want to monitor in the allowedpathlist.txt
        file, and then specify the paths you want to exclude from within them in the
        omitallowedpathlist.txt file.<br />Note: It is not recommended to omit changes made to
        service accounts from being audited as these accounts typically have elevated privileges and
        this is a security hole in your auditing.<br /><br />It must also be stressed that when you
        omit objects from being audited it is not for changes made BY these objects but rather TO
        these objects. For example, if you omit the USERS OU, the product will stop reporting
        changes made to accounts located in that OU, however, if a user from that OU performs some
        actions outside of that OU, these actions will be reported.
