        How do I delete old entries from the account list?

        <hr />

        You can delete old entries by selecting the accounts from 'All accounts' (multiple selection
        is supported) and clicking the Remove button. <br /><br />The account list is stored in the
        alinfo.xml file and you can manually delete the required accounts directly from the file. To
        do this, stop the product service, delete the account information (the information is
        enclosed in the &lt;ALObj&gt; and &lt;/ALObj&gt; tags, accounts are referred to as SIDs) and
        then start the service again.<br /><br /><img
