        <hr />

        *.ts files are being used by Active Directory Change Reporter to collect time stamps of when
        Active Directory objects were changed, these files are being created by the Active Directory
        Change Reporter agent, which is running under the Local System account but being collected
        by the main Active Directory Change Reporter process which is running under the specified
        service account. The error appear when User Account Control (UAC) (<a
          href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc709691(v=ws.10).aspx"

          >http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc709691(v=ws.10).aspx</a
        >) considers this difference as a potential security issue and blocks access to the *.ts
        file for the service account Active Directory Change Reporter is being run under.

        <hr />

        To resolve this issue, you need to disable User Account Control (UAC) on the problematic
        domain controller and delete the *.ts file Active Directory Change Report was able to
        access:
        <ol>
          <li>Log on the problematic domain controller</li>
          <li>Disable User Account Control (UAC)</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>Click Start, and then click Control Panel.</li>
          <li>In Control Panel, click User Accounts.</li>
          <li>In the User Accounts window, click User Accounts.</li>
          <li>In the User Accounts tasks window, click Turn User Account Control on or off.</li>
          <li>
            If UAC is currently configured in Admin Approval Mode, then the User Account Control
            message appears. Click Continue.
          </li>
          <li>
            Clear the Use User Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer check box, and
            then click OK.
          </li>
          <li>Restart domain controller</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          3. Once the domain controller is restarted, log onto it and delete the *.ts file Active
          Directory Change Report was able to access:
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>Navigate to C:WindowsADCR_Agent</li>
          <li>Fide the file listed in the error (%domain contoller name%.ts) and delete it</li>
          <li>Do not enable User Account Control (UAC) back.</li>
        </ul>
