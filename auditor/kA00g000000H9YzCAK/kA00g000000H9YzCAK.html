        You are getting the following error during the configuration of audit settings in your
        domain using the Active Directory Audit Configuration Wizard.
        <img
          src="kA00g000000H9YzCAK_234d0c0f-2fc5-4701-ab76-4676a763a5ff.png"
          alt="User-added image"
        />

        <hr />

        The account you use to run the <strong>Active Directory Audit Configuration</strong> wizard
        with Netwrix Auditor does not have the permissions to check current audit settings. The
        account must have the 'Managed Auditing and Security log' privilege.

        <hr />

        By default the <strong>Active Directory Audit Configuration </strong>wizard is run under the
        credentials of the current Windows session (On behalf of a user who logged in to the machine
        and started the Netwrix Auditor console). To resolve this issue, you need to log into the
        system as another user who has the required permission, or perform the following:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Go to the product installation folder, by default
            <strong>C:Program Files (x86)NetwrixActive Directory Auditing</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            Locate the <strong>Active Directory Audit Configuration </strong>shortcut<strong
              >.</strong
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            SHIFT + right-click on the
            <strong>Active Directory Audit Configuration </strong>shortcut,<strong> </strong>select
            "<strong>Run as different use</strong>r" and specify
            <strong>domain admin credentials, </strong>or an account that is known to have the
            'Managed Auditing and Security log' privilege.
          </li>
        </ol>
