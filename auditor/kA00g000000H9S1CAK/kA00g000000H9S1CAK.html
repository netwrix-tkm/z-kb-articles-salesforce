        <h2 id="question">Question</h2>

        <div>
          <p>Why was System stated in the WHO field in alert email instead of a user?</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            Alerts may contain System in the WHO field while daily Activity Summary emails or SQL
            reports will show the correct user.
          </p>

          <p>
            Once a change is received, the WHO or WHEN field might be missing. After collecting the
            change data, Netwrix Auditor will immediately check for the corresponding event in
            security event logs to collect WHO and WHEN fields data. Depending on the timing of the
            change and the collection process, this event might be missing from the security event
            log, e.g. due to a delayed queue of events written at the time for a particular domain
            controller.<br />To ensure timely delivery, the alert is sent out with as much data
            collected at the time.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            During the next quick data collection Netwrix Auditor will attempt to find the
            corresponding security event to collect data for missing fields of that change as well
            as new ones. If your Activity Summary report contains the WHO or WHEN data, the security
            event was properly written and collected. This won't be reflected in the alert, but data
            will be present for the activity stated in your daily review or in SQL Server report.
