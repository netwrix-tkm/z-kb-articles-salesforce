        Netwrix Auditor For Windows Servers (NetWrix Server Configuration Change Reporter in 6.5 or
        older) does not work with systems on different subnets.The following errors appear:
        &lt;server&gt; : Error during agent operation on server &lt;server&gt;. Cannot open Service
        Control Manager on computer '&lt;server&gt;'. This operation might require other privileges.
        Additional information: The RPC server is unavailable . &lt;server&gt; : Error during agent
        operation on server &lt;server&gt;. The RPC server is unavailable. (Exception from HRESULT:
        0x800706BA). Additional information: none. &lt;server&gt; : Error during agent operation on
        server &lt;server&gt;. Check if .Net Framework is installed error. Additional information:
        none.

        <hr />

        One of the required ports is blocked by Firewall.

        <hr />

        To resolve the issue, make sure the following ports are opened:
        <ol>
          <li>TCP 135 and TCP 445 are opened both ways.</li>
          <li>
            Dynamic RPC ports range are opened from the server where the Netwrix product is
            installed to the monitored server. The product uses these ports to connect to the
            monitored servers and launch the agent services. You can open the ports in two ways:
          </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>Open the following TCP ports range on your Firewall:</li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
          for Windows Vista/7/2008: 49152-65535 for Windows XP/2003: 1024-5000
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Alternatively, you can configure a custom Dynamic RPC ports range on the managed server,
            for example you can configure ports 50000-50200 and open these ports in your Firewall.
