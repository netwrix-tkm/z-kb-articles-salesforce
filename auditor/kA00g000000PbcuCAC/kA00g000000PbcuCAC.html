        <p>
          Specify connection details for your organization's app catalog (you may have more than one
          of these if you are working across multiple web applications if so, you will need to run
          the installer once per app catalog.

        <p>
          Enter the location of the conceptSearching server (which must be installed onto a secure
          with a secure (HTTPS) endpoint): In this case of SharePoint Online, the certificate used
          must be externally verifiable (from a trusted source).<br />Select the
          <b>Use SharePoint Online Login</b> checkbox if you want to use the new authentication
          method.

        />
        <p>
          Please also note, the HTTPS binding in IIS should have the host header specified, in the
          case of the above example the host header would be “secure.conceptsearching.com”. To do
          this please follow these steps:
        </p>

        <p>Open Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Open Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager</li>
          <li>

            (right-click, select Edit Bindings)
          </li>
          <li>Select the HTTPS port and select Edit</li>
          <li>
            Where possible edit the Host Name (Host Header field), if it is not possible please
            continue:
          </li>
          <li>
            Launch the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) a) Select Start –&gt; Run
            <ul>

              <li>Select Local Computer when prompted</li>
              <li>Click OK to add the Snap-in to the MMC</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>

          <li>Right-click on the certificate and select properties</li>
          <li>Edit the Friendly Name field so the name starts with an *</li>
          <li>Repeat steps #1 – 3 above</li>
        </ol>

        <p><em>Note that the Host Name (Host Header) field is now available for editing.</em></p>

        <p>
          Assuming you have not completed any of the steps of the installation previously you will
          then be shown the following screen, otherwise (if this is an upgrade), the installer will
          indicate that you can skip this step.

          This screen provides the information required to configure the app principal registration
          information which allows the conceptSearching products to communicate with SharePoint.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please follow the link provided and enter the information as shown, you will be required
          to generate a “Client Secret”, this is required for Azure ACS enabled environments, and
          not for on-premise environments that wish to use a certificate trust configuration. Please
          click the "Generate” button for the client secret and make a note of this in a secure
          location. Here is an example of the completed registration form:
        </p>

        />
        <p>The app should then be ready for installation, click “Install” to proceed”.</p>

        <p>
          The app will now be deployed to your app catalog and ready for installation on your site
          collections:

        >
          If you wish to use the conceptClassifierApp in an on-premise environment you will need to
          complete a few additional steps shown in step 1, otherwise, skip to step 2.
        </h3>

        <p><strong>1. Building the trust relationship for an on-premise environment</strong></p>

        <p>
          (A) To begin the app model should be enabled on the farm. By following the steps in the
          following link the SharePoint farm will be ready to make use of any SharePoint apps:
        </p>

        <p>
          <a
            href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161236(v=office.15).aspx"
            target="_blank"
            >http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fp161236(v=office.15).aspx</a
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          (B) Next, it is necessary to build a trust relationship between the SharePoint server and
          the server that will be hosting the conceptQS, this is to allow the QS to make requests
          back to SharePoint (please note that this is still necessary even if the QS is hosted on
          the same server as the SharePoint site). Please now proceed through the following help
          guide:
        </p>

        <p>
          <a
            href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/fp179901(v=office.15).aspx"
            target="_blank"
            >http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/fp179901(v=office.15).aspx</a
          >
        </p>

        <p><strong>2. Configuring the services with the authentication configuration</strong></p>

        <p>First, navigate to the following URL:</p>

        <p><em>/conceptQS/Sources/SharePoint/AppConfiguration</em></p>

        <p>Select the appropriate tab:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Azure Access Control Service (ACS) should be used for Office 365</li>
          <li>Server-to-Server (S2S) should be used for an on-premise environment</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Please complete the necessary fields, if you are an Office 365 customer you will need your
          client secret, otherwise, you will need the values completed in step 1,(B) above
        </p>
