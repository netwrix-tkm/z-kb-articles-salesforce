        <h2 id="causes">Causes</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            Netwrix Auditor is unable to collect data on group membership of users who made changes.
            This does not affect audit data integrity and only affects the possibility to filter
            data by groups in audit reports. Most likely, this is due to access issues to the AD
            domain that users belong to, or the membership database.
          </p>
