        <strong>Q1</strong>: How do I populate the Account list with my users? Should I add each one
        individually or is there a method to add all users from a domain at once?<br /><strong
          >A1</strong
        >: Accounts are added to the list as soon as they are locked out. You do not need to
        populate the list.<br /><br /><strong>Q2</strong>: Does Account Lockout Examiner have
        Windows 2008/R2 Server Support?<br /><strong>A2</strong>: The last version of Account
        Lockout Examiner has full support for Windows Server 2008/R2 domain controllers.<br /><br /><strong
          >Q3</strong
        >: Can NetWrix Account Lockout Examiner run as a Windows service?<br /><strong>A3</strong>:
        NetWrix Account Lockout Examiner runs as a service, therefore it is not necessary to keep
        the program open once it has been configured.<br /><br /><strong>Q4</strong> Is IIS required
        on the machine/server where NetWrix Account Lockout Examiner is installed?<br /><strong
          >A4</strong
        >: Internet Information Services (IIS ) is only required for NetWrix Account Lockout
        Examiner Help-Desk Portal. If the Help-Desk Portal and NetWrix Account Lockout Examiner are
        installed on different computers, IIS must be installed on the computer with the Help-Desk
        Portal.<br /><br /><strong>Q5</strong>: What the WMI queries are talking to on the DCs?<br /><strong
          >A5</strong
        >: This queries use Windows Instrumentation management Service and requests for a) reading
        the security log and b) reading of account state Here are some fields that are queried:
        <ul>
          <li>Win32_UserAccount</li>
          <li>Win32_NTLogEvent</li>
          <li>__InstanceCreationEvent</li>
          <li>win32_process</li>
          <li>Win32_OperatingSystem</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><strong>Q6</strong>: Is a separate license required for the NetWrix Account Lockout
        Help-Desk Portal?<br /><strong>A6</strong>: No, you do not need a separate license. The
        Help-Desk portal is a part of NetWrix Account Lockout Examiner, so if you have purchased the
        product, the web portal goes with it.
