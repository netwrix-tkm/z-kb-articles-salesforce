        Netwrix Account Lockout Examiner tracks account lockouts in real time, enables proactive
        lockout resolutions, and helps administrators to effectively troubleshoot account
        lockouts.<br /><br />Account Lockout Examiner is able to determine the origins of lockouts
        and show detailed information about specified lockouts and invalid logons. The Account
        Lockout Examiner tool processes Windows security logs without using agents so that the audit
        policy in the domain be setup, according to the requirements of the tool. Configuration of
        the audit policy is described in the admin guide and this
        <a href="http://kb.netwrix.com/1199" target="_blank">article</a>.Â <br /><br />Since Windows
        Security log is the only source, Account Lockout Examiner is able to show only the
        information that is present in the log. After Account Lockout Examiner finds a lockout
        event, it adds the information about account lockout to the list in the Summary tab.
        Administrator can investigate an account lockout with the help of the Examination feature.
        <h3 id="conducting_an_examination">Conducting an Examination</h3>
        To run an examination, an administrator clicks the Examine button at the bottom of the list
        in the Summary tab, or right-clicks an account and select Examine. Examination shows a list
        of invalid logons, specifies the names of the processes that have used invalid credentials,
        and checks the most common reasons of lockouts: mapped drives, scheduled tasks, RDP
        sessions, and services running under credentials of the account in question. Examination
        results look like this:
