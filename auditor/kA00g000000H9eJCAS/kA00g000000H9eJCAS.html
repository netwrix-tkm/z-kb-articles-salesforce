        <p>
          When upgrading from old versions of Netwrix Auditor, you must do
          that <strong>incrementally</strong>. Below is the list of approved upgrade paths up to the
          version 10.5.
        </p>
        <h2 id="before_you_start">Before you start</h2>
        <p>
          To successfully access the download packages, ensure you are logged in with your customer
          portal account at
          <a href="https://www.netwrix.com/my_account.html" target="_blank">Netwrix.com</a>.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <span><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong></span>Make sure the free disk space in your SQL
            server totals to at least 30% of the total size of all Netwrix Auditor-related
            databases. This will allow for the database growth during the upgrade.
          </p>

        <h2 id="upgrade_recommendations">Upgrade Recommendations</h2>
        <h4 id="for_versions_older_than_95">For versions older than 9.5</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Upgrading from versions older than 9.5 is not recommended!</strong> Incremental
            upgrades may cause error accumulation and cause issues with the product stability
            post-upgrade. Best practices recommend that you leave your Netwrix Auditor as is for
            historical reports and start a new server with the latest version installed. Proceed
            only if you absolutely have to.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure to wait at least 24 hours before upgrading to the next version, so that the
            product has enough time time upgrade your databases.
          </li>
          <li>Contact Technical Support for download links for Netwrix Auditor 8.5 and 9.5</li>
          <li>
            Once 8.5 is installed, you will need to run the upgrade of your Audit Databases
            manually. To do this, launch Netwrix Auditor Administrator Console, navigate to
            <strong>Audit Archive </strong>&gt; <strong>Audit Database</strong> and then click
            <strong>Upgrade</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="for_versions_95_and_newer">For Versions 9.5 and Newer</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Upgrading to Auditor v10.6 requires .NET 4.8 on the Auditor server and on any servers
              included in a Windows Server or User Activity Monitoring Plan that have the
              Compression Service enabled.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <span class="Caution"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong></span>Plan your upgrade
                carefully. .NET 4.8 requires Windows Server 2016 or later and may require a server
                reboot after installation.
              </p>

            <p>
              Starting from the version 9.9 Netwrix implemented the new license format. To reissue
              the license:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If you upgrade incrementally, just follow steps given in the
                  <strong>Upgrade Paths</strong> table below, and your license will upgrade
                  automatically.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If you leave your Netwrix Auditor as is and start a new server with the latest
                  version, contact your Account Manager and request the newly formatted license.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not pause the upgrade chain in the middle for a long time as this may leave your
            system in a vulnerable state. The latest product version includes all functionality from
            the previous versions, adds new features and includes important security updates.
          </li>
          <li>
            After each incremental update, you must wait for the DBs to be upgraded. In large/busy
            environments, this may take up to 24 hours. Check the Health Log to see if database was
            upgraded successfully. Event IDs <b>4410 </b>and <b>4405 </b>indicate that upgrade was
            done successfully, any other 44XX Event IDs indicate that there was an error.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have the capability to capture a snapshot of the server, we recommend doing so.
            Before we begin, launch a PowerShell session as Administrator and execute the following
            command:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="ckeditor_codeblock">Stop-Service -Displayname Netwrix*</pre>
        <p>This will stop all Netwrix Services and prevent complications during the upgrade.</p>
