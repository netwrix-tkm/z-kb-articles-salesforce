        How do I configure the Disk Space Monitor to work behind a Firewall?

        <hr />

        A Firewall may prevent Disk Space Monitor attempts to connect to the server and get
        information about the disk space. Make sure that port 135 is open.<br /><br />Perform the
        following steps:<br />1. Run the firewall by going to Start | Control Panel | Windows
        Firewall.<br />2. Click the Exceptions tab and check the list of Programs and Services.<br />3.
        Make sure the list of Programs and Services contains the DCOM_TCP135 line.<br /><br />If
        DCOM_TCP135 is not in the list of Programs and Services, perform the following steps:<br />1.
        Go to Start | Run | type "cmd" and press OK.<br />2. Type "netsh firewall add portopening
        protocol=tcp port=135 name=DCOM_TCP135" and press Enter.<br />3. Go to Start | Control Panel
        | Windows Firewall.<br />4. Click the Exceptions tab and make sure DCOM_TCP135 has been
        added to the list of Program and Services.<br />5. Go to Start | Control Panel| | Schedule
        Tasks. Run the Netwrix Disk Space Monitor scheduled task.<br />6. Open the mailbox you have
        specified to receive notifications and make sure the report displays disk space information
        about the server in question.
