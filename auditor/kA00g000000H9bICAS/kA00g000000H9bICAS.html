        Password Expiration Notifier has two options for user notifications:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Notify a user whose password is going to expire in X days
            <strong>every day</strong> during X days. In this case all people listed in admin report
            will receive a notification every day.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Notify a user <strong>only 3 times</strong> on certain days, i.e., when the
            specified number of days is left until password expiration. By default it is 14, 7 and 3
            days. In this case admin report will still be sent every day, but only people with
            exactly 14, 7 or 3 days until password expiration will receive a notification.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <hr />
        Please make sure Password Expiration Notifier is configured correctly. Also please make sure
        that notifications are not considered as spam.
