        You are running Netwrix Auditor under non-admin account in DCs with Windows 2000 and Windows
        Server 2003 and object deletion does not show up in reports and alerts.

        <hr />

        When an Active Directory object is deleted, its image stays in the Deleted Objects container
        for a specified time. Due to this feature other domain controllers that are replicating
        changes become aware of the deletion. By default, only System account and members of
        Administrators group can view the contents of this container. This article describes how to
        modify the permissions on the deleted objects container. You may have to modify permissions
        on the Deleted Objects container if the following conditions are true:
        <ul>
          <li>
            You have enterprise applications or services that bind to Active Directory with a
            non-System account or a non-Administrator account
          </li>
          <li>These enterprise applications or services poll directory for changes</li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        To modify permissions on the Deleted Objects container so that non-administrators can view
        this container, use the <strong>DSACLS.exe</strong> program. The DSACLS.exe program is
        included in Active Directory Application Mode (ADAM) Administration Tools. To obtain and
        install the <strong>ADAM Administration Tools</strong>, perform the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Download the ADAM retail package. This file is available for download from the Microsoft
            Download Center, please follow this link :

            >; <strong>Note:</strong> This version of the ADAM Administration Tools is an upgrade
            from the version in the Windows Server 2003 Support Tools. This version of the ADAM
            Administration Tools is supported by Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition;
            Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition; Microsoft Windows Server 2003,
            Datacenter Edition; and Microsoft Windows XP Professional. On Microsoft Windows Server
            2008 this tool is already installed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Double-click <strong>Adamsetup.exe</strong> program to start the Active Directory
            Application Mode Setup Wizard.
          </li>
          <li>Select ADAM administration tools only, and then click Next.</li>
          <li>Proceed with the wizard.</li>
        </ol>
        After you have installed the <strong>ADAM Administration Tools</strong>, you can modify the
        permissions on the deleted objects container. To do this, perform the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Log on with a user account that is a member of the <strong>Domain Admins</strong> group.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click <strong>Start -&gt; All Programms -&gt; ADAM</strong> and then click
            <strong>ADAM Tools Command Prompt.</strong>
          </li>
          <li>
            At the command prompt, type a command similar to the following example:
            <div>
              <strong><em>dsacls "CN=Deleted Objects,DC=Contoso,DC=com" /takeownership</em></strong>
            </div>
            <div><strong>Note:</strong></div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When you type this command, use the name of the deleted objects container for your
                domain.
              </li>
              <li>Each domain in the forest will have its own deleted objects container.</li>
            </ul>
            <div>
              Output that is similar to the following example should be displayed:

              <strong>Explanation: </strong>In this example, the user
              "<strong>CONTOSOEricLang</strong>" has been granted List Contents and Read Property
              permissions on the deleted objects container in the "<strong>CONTOSO</strong>" domain.
              These permissions let this user view the contents of the deleted objects container,
              but do not let this user make any changes to objects in the container. These
              permissions are equivalent to the default permissions that are granted to the
              Administrators group. By default, only the System account has permission to modify
              objects in the deleted objects container.
