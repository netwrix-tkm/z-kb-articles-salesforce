        ser Account Lockouts and Unlocks are missing and the corresponding reports are empty, even
        though some accounts are known to have been locked/unlocked in the selected period. Daily
        summary reports also do not show any lockouts or unlocks.
        <hr />
        The most common reason for this issue is disabled Audit Account Management policy or some
        conflicts in policies. Account lockouts, unlocks and Password resets are event-based changes
        which means that if the audit setting is disabled account lockouts will be detected but will
        not be included into reports or trigger alerts because there are no corresponding auditing
        events.
        <hr />
        In order to resolve the issue we need to make sure that audit policy is configured
        correctly. In the corresponding Group Policy Object (or Local policy if you configured
        auditing there)
        <ol>
          <li>
            Go to<b>
              Computer Configuration - Policies - Security Settings - Local Policies - Audit
              Policy</b
            >
          </li>
          <li>Make sure <b>Audit Account Management</b> is set to <b>Success</b></li>
        </ol>
         If you use Advanced Audit Policy please check the following setting:

        <ol>
          <li>
            Go to<b>
              Computer Configuration - Policies - Security Settings - Advanced Audit Policy
              Configuration - Audit Policies - Account management</b
            >
          </li>
          <li>Make sure <b>Audit User Account Management</b> is set to <b>Success</b></li>
        </ol>
         Even if Group Policy Object is configured correctly there might still be some conflicts
        that prevent GP from applying correctly. To find out the effective audit policy on a DC,
        execute the following command <b>auditpol /get /category:*</b> In the output check that
        <b>User Account Management</b> is set to <b>Success</b>  For more information on Group
        Policy and related issue refer to the following articles:
