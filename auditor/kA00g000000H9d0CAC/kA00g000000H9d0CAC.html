        <b>Error type 1:</b>
        <i
          >An unexpected error occurred while trying to collect security events from the audited
          SharePoint farm: Details: Could not find the file: </i

          GUID*&gt;&lt;any file&gt;.</i

        <b>Error type 2:</b>
        <span
          ><i
            >An unexpected error occurred while trying to collect security events from the audited
            SharePoint farm: Details: The content type text/html; charset=utf-8 of the response
            message does not match the content type of the binding (text/xml; charset=utf-8). If
            using a custom encoder, be sure that the IsContentTypeSupported method is implemented
            properly. The first 45 bytes of the response were: 'Cannot connect to the configuration
            database.'..</i
          ></span
        >

        <b>Error type 3:</b>
        <i
          ><span
            >An unexpected error occurred while trying to collect security events from the audited
            SharePoint farm: The request change timed out while waiting for a reply after 01:00:00.
            Increase the timeout value passed to the call to Request or increase the SendTimeout
            value on the Binding. The time allotted to this operation may have been a portion of a
            longer timeout.</span

        Review the possible error causes:

        <b>Error type 1:</b>
        <span
          >The product failed to collect audit data due to a an unexpected error on the Netwrix
          Auditor side. There is no access to the configuration files, or the file is corrupt.</span
        >

        <b>Error type 2:</b>
        <span
          >The product failed to collect audit data due to an unexpected error on the SharePoint
          side. The site collection configuration is corrupt, or there is no access to the
          SharePoint configuration database.</span
        >

        <b>Error type 3:</b>
        <span
          >The product failed to collect audit data as the timeout expired on the SharePoint side.
          This can be due to maintenance activity in your network, which results in the failure to
          process requests on the SharePoint side.</span
        >

        Depending on the received error type, follow the corresponding resolution prompts:
