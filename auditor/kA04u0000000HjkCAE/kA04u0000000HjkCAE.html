        <h2 id="problem">Problem</h2>
        When I subscribe to the report and want to have report results delivered to the certain
        folder, I get an "Access Denied" error, despite the fact that the account has full
        permissions to upload a file there.

        <h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>
        When you select the “Upload to a file share” option in the create\edit subscription menu
        (‘General’ tab), Netwrix uses different accounts to upload the report to the share:

        <ul>
          <li>
            For SSRS-based subscriptions, the account specified for Long-Term Archive (LTA) is used,
            as reflected in our documentation:
            https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/Configure_IT_Infrastructure/Configure_NA_Roles/Configure_Roles_LTA.html
          </li>
          <li>
            For Search-based and Risk Assessment reports, Netwrix uses a Local System account,
            regardless of which account was specified for LTA.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />As a result, with different types of subscriptions and a custom LTA account, you must
        give access to the share to two accounts at once: the computer account of the Netwrix server
        and the LTA account.
