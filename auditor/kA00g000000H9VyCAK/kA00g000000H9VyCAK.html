        Netwrix Auditor for SQL Server changes have "System" reported in the WHO field.
        <hr />
        Netwrix Auditor for SQL Server <span>is using two sources of data for analysis: </span>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <span
              ><a
                href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd392015(v=sql.100).aspx"
                target="_blank"
                >SQL Server native auditing</a
              >
              - </span
            ><span>used for retrieving change details</span>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span
              >SQL Server configuration snapshot - used for determining what has changed since the
              previous data collection.</span
            >
          </li>
        </ul>
        <span>For example: </span>
        <span
          >You have changed the column parameters. This action must be captured by SQL Server native
          auditing and logged into the auditing log on the SQL Server (with information on Who made
          the change and When the change was made).
        </span>
        Netwrix Auditor for SQL Server w<span
          >ill detect that change during the snapshot comparison (the column parameter has been
          changed) and then search the SQL Server native auditing logs for corresponding events to
          add WHO CHANGED and WHEN CHANGED information. If the corresponding event cannot be found,
          the product reports WHO as SYSTEM.
        </span>
        You can always prove the system changes by reviewing the SQL Server native auditing logs. In
        order to do that please open the SQL Server Profiler application and open SQL traces from
        <a target="_blank"><span>C:\Program</span></a
        ><span> </span>Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL10_50.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\Log<br />Note: the
        path above may vary depending on the version of SQL Server you have installed.
