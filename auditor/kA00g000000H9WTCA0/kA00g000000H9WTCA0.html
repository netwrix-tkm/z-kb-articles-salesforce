        How to configure User Activity to start recording when a particular program is launched?
        <hr />
        Netwrix Auditor for User Activity offers three options:<br />1) Record when any application
        is run.<br />2) Record when a specific application is run.<br />3) Record when any
        application is run except the ones specified.<br /><br />This article addresses #2 and #3
        specifically as the way in which the application names are entered is the same for both.
        Note: It is required that the program has a window with a title. For example programs
        executed via command line without a GUI would not apply.<br /><br />There are two ways to
        find the application description:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Launch the application you want to monitor and start Task Manager. In the Task Manager
            dialog, open the <strong>Processes</strong> tab and look for the application description
            in the <strong>Description</strong> column.
          </li>
          <li>
            Locate the executable file for the application you want to monitor, right-click it and
            select <strong>Properties</strong>. In the <strong>Properties</strong> dialog, switch to
            the <strong>Details</strong> tab and look for the application description in the
            <strong>File Description </strong>field.
          </li>
        </ol>
        Note: Although the video recording will only start when a particular application is opened,
        it still records the entire screen.<br /><strong>Example:</strong> If you want to configure
        to record each time Notepad is open you would use <em>Notepad</em> as the Application
        Description and for the Window Title you can use something like *Notepad* as the word
        "Notepad" is always in the Window Title regardless of the name of the document open.
