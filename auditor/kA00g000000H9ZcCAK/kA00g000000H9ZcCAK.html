        The disk on a monitored file server is overfilled with Security event log auto archives.

        <hr />

        <div>Disk overfilling can be caused by the following reasons:</div>
        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>Removal of processed auto archives is not configured.</li>
            <li>
              The maximum size of the Security event log does not meet

              ><span> recommendations, </span>so Netwrix Auditor cannot process auto archives and
              remove them.
            </li>
            <li>
              The disk where auto archives are stored is too small to contain all archives
              accumulated between two Netwrix Auditor data collections.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Check whether the automatic removal is configured. On the computer where Netwrix Auditor
            is installed, perform the following:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Navigate to <strong>Start --&gt; Run</strong> and type
                <strong><em>regedit</em></strong
                >.
              </li>
              <li>
                Expand
                <strong
                  >HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/(Wow6432Node)/Netwrix/File Server Change
                  Reporter.</strong
                >
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure <strong>ProcessBackupLogs </strong>is set<strong> </strong>to
                <strong><em>1</em>.</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure <strong>CleanAutoBackupLogs</strong> is set to X - a positive integer
                number (the archive is removed when all events are older than
                <strong>X</strong> hours).
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>

            If the automatic removal option is enabled, check the audit archives creation date.

                If archives are stored longer than it is defined by the limiting

                <strong>CleanAutoBackupLogs </strong>parameter, and <strong>Security </strong>event

                ><span> </span>requirements, it means that audit archives fill the free disk space
                before Netwrix Auditor removes them. To resolve this issue, do one of the following:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Change location of the Event Viewer log files. Move them to a disk with more
                    free space available. Audit archives will be accumulated on the disk and removed
                    after the data collection.<strong>Note</strong>: For information on how to do
                    this for Windows 2000 and Windows Server 2003, refer to the following
                    <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315417" target="_blank"
                      >Microsoft technical article</a
                    >. For Windows Server 2008 and above, log location can be changed under the log
                    properties. It is recommended to reboot your server after this manipulations.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Configure Netwrix Auditor to run data collection more frequently and decrease
                    the value of the <strong>CleanAutoBackupLogs </strong>parameter. If the task
                    runs frequently enough to prevent the Security event log from being overfilled,
                    you can disable the automatic archiving option (the disk will not be overfilled,
                    but this can lead to audit data loss). To adjust the data collection schedule,
                    in Netwrix Auditor, navigate to
                    <strong>Settings --&gt; Data Collection, </strong>click
                    <strong>Modify</strong> next to
                    <strong>Default data collection and Change Summary generation schedule. </strong
                    >In the <strong>Modify Schedule </strong>dialogue select
                    <strong>Advanced </strong>and adjust the schedule as necessary.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <div>
          <strong>Note:</strong> Before updating the <strong>CleanAutoBackupLogs </strong>parameter,
          make sure that Netwrix Auditor has enough time to process audit archives for other audited
          systems before the archives are removed.
