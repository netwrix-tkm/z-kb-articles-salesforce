            In cases, when you already have Auditor installed on a server and, for some reasons, do
            not want to upgrade the product and migrate the configuration to another server, you
            might want to perform clear install of Netwrix Auditor to this machine. How to make sure
            the new server installation/configuration doesn't encounter problems related to the old
            Netwrix server?

        <h3 id="question_1">Question 1</h3>

        <div>
          <p>
            Do I need to uninstall Netrix compression services from all the nodes that the previous
            installation/server was monitoring before I build new server?
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="answer">Answer</h3>

        <div>
          <p>
            No, because Netwrix Auditor is supposed to automatically uninstall compression services
            upon removing the targeted machine/location or items from monitoring plans.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="question_2">Question 2</h3>

        <div>
          <p>
            Does Netwrix Auditor uninstallation from my server removes all Netwrix compression
            services or do I have to manually uninstall them from all nodes?
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3 id="answer">Answer</h3>

        <div>
          <p>
            In most cases, yes it does. However, for the proper uninstallation of all compression
            services, Netwrix recommends following the procedure below:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                In Netwrix Auditor, navigate to <b>Monitoring plans</b> and remove the
                <b>items</b> first.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Wait for the host server someÂ to synchronize with nodes that have the compression
                services installed. Depending on your Auditor configuration, the uninstallation
                process might take a while. Wait for a couple of hours for the uninstallation to
                take effect.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Double check that the compression services were uninstalled successfully.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Delete all <b>monitoring plans</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Uninstall Netwrix Auditor itself.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
