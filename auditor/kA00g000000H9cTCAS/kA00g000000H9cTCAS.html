        Refer to the <a href="https://kb.netwrix.com/258" target="_blank">KB258</a> for details
        about how Netwrix Auditor for VMware works. Overwrites warnings occur because there is some
        gap between the last collected and the oldest of newly received events. Try running
        collections more frequently by changing the notifications frequency under Monitoring Plan
        settings. If this doesn't help please perform the following steps to troubleshot this and
        localize the problematic place: After receiving a change report for VMware with event
        overwrites warning and changes, which as a results of event overwrites were reported as made
        by system, retrieve audit events using VMware PowerCLI cmdlets by connecting to vCenter and
        ESX hosts:<br /><br />1. Download and install VMware PowerCLI, this package contains set of
        Powershell cmdlets which can be used to retrieve audit events from ESX server vCenter.<br />2.
        Install-Module -Name VMware.PowerCLI -Scope CurrentUser<br />3. Import-Module
        VMware.PowerCLI<br />4. Set-PowerCLIConfiguration -InvalidCertificateAction Ignore<br />5.
        Run the Connect-VIServer cmdlet and connect to the VMware host (<a
          href="https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/windowstoolkit/wintk40u1/html/Connect-VIServer.html"
          target="_blank"
          >https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/windowstoolkit/wintk40u1/html/Connect-VIServer.html</a
        >) by running this command: Connect-VIServer "ESX hostname"
        <ul>
          <li>
            A credentials window will appear. Enter the account that will read data from the
            vCenter.
          </li>
        </ul>
        6. Run Get-VIEvent cmdlet (<a
          href="https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/windowstoolkit/wintk40u1/html/Get-VIEvent.html"
          target="_blank"
          >https://www.vmware.com/support/developer/windowstoolkit/wintk40u1/html/Get-VIEvent.html</a
        >) and get all events for last 24 hours by running the command:<br /><br />Get-VIEvent
        -Entity * -Start (Get-Date).AddDays(-1) &gt;&gt; C:%ESX_host_name%.txt If the cmdlet returns
        timeout error, you might try to reduce the timeframe of requested events: Get-VIEvent
        -Entity * -Start (Get-Date).AddHours(-1) &gt;&gt; C:%ESX_host_name%.txt
        <div>
          Get-VIEvent -Entity * -Start (Get-Date).AddMinutes(-10) &gt;&gt; C:%ESX_host_name%.txt
        </div>
        Perform these steps for every ESX host which is managed with vCenter specified in Netwrix
        Auditor for VMware<br /><br />7.
