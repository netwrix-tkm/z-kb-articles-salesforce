          <p>Why Netwrix sends alerts on accounts that cannot be locked out?</p>

        <h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            If an account was to be locked based on certain rules within Windows such as too many
            bad password attempts, even if it cannot be locked, Windows will still generate Event ID
            4740 despite the failure.
          </p>

          <p>

          </p>

          <p>
            If you configured alerts triggered by lockout events, Netwrix Auditor reacts to these
            Events even in case of failed attempts and sends the corresponding alert.
          </p>

          <p>
            Alerts contain also an account RID, that is a unique ID within Netwrix that ties it to
            the alert that was fired off which would allow you to look into it more thoroughly.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can then select an alert that fired off and click
            <b>Show activity record in a new window</b> to the bottom right, which will show you the
            details of the event.
