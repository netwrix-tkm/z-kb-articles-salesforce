        Does Inactive User Tracking alert before it performs any actions on accounts?
        <hr />
        Although Inactive User Tracking does not alert you prior to performing actions on a user
        based on the configuration you selected, it will, as a precaution, choose to not perform any
        actions on an account or computer if there were any errors gathering the necessary
        timestamps from domain controllers. Specifically, the product will NOT perform any actions
        if any DC was unavailable at the time of data collection.
