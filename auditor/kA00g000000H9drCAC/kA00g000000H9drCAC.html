                The backup software solution deployed in our environment does not handle revolving
                recovery models well. Is it possible to keep them static?

                Netwrix Auditor databases use simple recovery model by default. The simple model
                ensures optimal performance and efficient SQL Server resources usage, aimed to
                minimize the transaction log size. Occasionally the recovery model of Netwrix
                Auditor databases may switch to bulk-logged to revert back to simple. The change
                happens during the State-in-Time snapshots upload âˆ’ the bulk-logged recovery model
                ensures data consistency when uploading larger data, like State-in-Time snapshots.
                This behavior is intended for the normal product workflow and cannot be changed.

                Netwrix Auditor stores copied collected data in Long-Term Archive to allow the
                import to a dedicated database when required. There is no need to back up Netwrix
                databases âˆ’ it is recommended to exclude them from the scope of your backup software
                solution. If backup is absolutely needed, it is recommended to use native SQL Server
                backup functionality instead of backing up <code>.mdf</code> and
                <code>.ldf</code> files via the file system. If this is not an option, the only
                solution would be disabling State-in-Time feature for the monitoring plans that use
                the corresponding databases.
