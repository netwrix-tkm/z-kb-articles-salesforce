        <div>
          <p>
            Is there a process we need to follow on the Netwrix server to prepare for an upgrade?
            This is an in-place upgrade of SQL 2014 to SQL 2019. We have backups and plan to
            snapshot the virtual machines before starting. Are there any steps to take on the
            Netwrix application server before and after the SQL upgrade?
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            There is no need to back up anything on the Netwrix server when performing SQL upgrades.
            You also don't need to back up the config file.

            <span><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> However, as an additional precautionary measure, you
            have the option of taking a snapshot of the Netwrix host before starting any upgrade
            procedures
