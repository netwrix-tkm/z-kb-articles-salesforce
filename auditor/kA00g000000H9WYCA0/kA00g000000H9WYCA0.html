        How do I filter out certain users from mailbox access reports?

        <hr />

        <div>
          To exclude a specific user from the mailbox access reports you need to add that user to
          <strong>userstoexclude.txt </strong>located<strong> i</strong>n the product installation
          directory. Since this file is read in the beginning of each data collection, it would only
          affect newly collected data.
          <div>The file structure is following:</div>
          <ul>
            <li>Each entry must be a separate line.</li>
            <li>Wildcards (* and ?) are supported.</li>
            <li>Lines that start with the # sign are treated as comments and are ignored.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <img
            src="kA00g000000H9WYCA0_83f3ffb4-d360-45dc-a97a-368ee9eb261b.png"
            alt="User-added image"
            width="500"
            height="398"
          />

          <strong>NOTE</strong>. The <strong>userstoexclude.txt</strong> file contains a list of
          users who must be excluded from reports if they perform non-owner access to mailboxes. But
          the audit data for these users will still be stored in the snapshots, so if a user is
          removed from this list, the information on the user actions can be viewed with the Report
          Viewer.
