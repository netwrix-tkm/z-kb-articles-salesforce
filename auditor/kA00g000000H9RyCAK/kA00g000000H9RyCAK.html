        <div>
          <p>
            Why were some Active Directory changes duplicated with System and Unknown in
            <strong>WHO</strong> and <strong>WHERE</strong> fields correspondingly?
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            Active Directory reports may contain a change and its duplicate with System in the
            <strong>WHO</strong> field and Unknown in the <strong>WHERE</strong> field. This
            behavior is expected due to the DirSync control design.<br />During data collection,
            Netwrix Auditor collects changes via DirSync control through the same domain controller
            each time. If the domain controller is unavailable at the time of data collection,
            Netwrix Auditor switches to another domain controller. Data collected from the new
            domain controller may include changes reported by the previous domain controller.<br /><br />You
            can verify this behavior â€” follow the
            <code>%Working Folder%\AD Change Reporter\Omitlists\%YOUR_DOMAIN%</code> path to open
            dirsyncdclist.txt in any text editor. If this file contains more than one domain
            controller, the DCs listed in the file were not always available for data collection.<br />You
            can delete the dirsyncdclist.txt file. During the next data collection Netwrix Auditor
            will connect to the first available comain controller and recreate the dirsyncdclist.txt
            file to contain the new domain controller.
