        >" value in the "<strong><em>Who</em></strong
        >" column. and there are no errors and warnings in the Netwrix Auditor System Health log.
        <hr />
        There possible cause of this issue is Security Event Log on the File Server:
        <ul>
          <li>The Security event log is not populated with new events.</li>
          <li>The Security event log was relocated.</li>
        </ul>

        <div>
          <hr />
        </div>

        <ul>
          <li>
            If you changed the Security event log location and did not reboot your file server, the
            system services may fail to update their settings based on the updated configuration.
            Therefore, you must reboot your file server.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you did not relocate the Security event log, perform one of the following to resolve
            the issue:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Open the Security event log using the Event Viewer. If the log is corrupted or
                contains events with ID 521, this may indicate that there is not enough free disk
                space to store new information. Provide more disk space and clear the log. Refer to
                the
                <a href="https://kb.netwrix.com/1262" target="_blank"

              </li>
              <li>
                Make sure that either the <strong>Overwrite events as needed</strong> retention
                method is selected, or the Security log automatic archiving option is enabled: <a
