        <div>
          <p>
            Why were changes to the directory objects for Foreign Security Principals reported as
            made by System?
          </p>
        </div>

            This behavior is expected. The Foreign Security Principals container in Active Directory
            represent security principals from trusted domains external to the forest. It allows
            foreign security principals to become members of groups within the domain. The Foreign
            Security Principals objects are created automatically by Active Directory represented by
            System. Changes of foreignSecurityPrincipal objects reported as made by System are
            reported as intended.<br /><br />For additional information on the Foreign Security
            Principals container and the Foreign Security Principals objects, refer to the following
