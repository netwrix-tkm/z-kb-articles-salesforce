          Netwrix Auditor leverages accounts with privileges considered higher than regular users"
          for target systems configuration, access, and data collection. Therefore, credentials of
          those accounts must be stored on the Netwrix Auditor server in a secure manner.
          <br /><br />For that, Netwrix Auditor utilizes a native Microsoft Windows cryptographic
          mechanism called Data Protection API (DPAPI) based on
          <a
            href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/cryptography-portal"
            target="_blank"
            >Crypto API</a
          >. Detailed information on DPAPI implementation by Microsoft can be found in
          <a

        <ul>
          <li>
            Usage of DPAPI is recommended by Microsoft for encryption of sensitive data at rest
            (such as passwords or
            <a
              href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/data-protection/implementation/key-encryption-at-rest?view=aspnetcore-3.0#windows-dpapi"
              target="_blank"
              >master keys</a
            >). Also, DPAPI is used by Microsoft services to store credentials (e.g., Remote Desktop
            Connection).
          </li>
          <li>
            DPAPI is built-in in the Microsoft Windows operating system. Therefore, all
            enhancements, updates and security bug fixes are provided through regular Windows
            Update.

              >CryptoAPI</a
            >
            under the hood of DPAPI uses proven cryptographic algorithms such as AES 256-bit for
            data encryption. They can be adjusted to the specific needs of a company through
            <a href="" target="_blank">Cryptographic Service Providers</a> configuration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Master keys used by DPAPI for data encryption are managed by Microsoft Windows OS;
            third-party applications and Netwrix Auditor, in particular, do not access or control
            them.

        <p class="has-text-color">Frequently Asked Questions</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Q:</strong> What cryptographic algorithm is used for encryption?<br /><strong
            >A:</strong
          >
          Since Netwrix Auditor relies on DPAPI instead of directly handling encryption, the actual
          mechanism is defined by the Windows operation system. Netwrix does not have control over
          selection of cryptographic algorithms. <br /><br /><a
            href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccrypto/cryptography-portal"
            target="_blank"
            >CryptoAPI</a
          >
          under the hood of DPAPI uses proven cryptographic algorithms for data encryption such as
          AES 256-bit.<br /><br />
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Q:</strong> What if someone unauthorized gets a copy of the
          <em>Configuration.xml</em> file on another machine and then tries to decrypt passwords
          stored in it?<br /><strong>A:</strong> Microsoft Data Protection API provides mechanism to
          associate encrypted data with the machine context. Netwrix uses this approach by utilizing
          CRYPTPROTECT_LOCAL_MACHINE flag for encryption. This ensures that the data can be
          decrypted only on the same machine it has been encrypted on.<br /><br />
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Q:</strong> What should Netwrix administrators do to keep Netwrix Auditor as
          secure as possible?<br /><strong>A: </strong>The most important thing is to limit access
          to the Netwrix Auditor server. Just authorized personnel should have access to the Netwrix
          Auditor server.
        </p>

        <p>
          The access level must be thoroughly adjusted as well; regular Netwrix Auditor users don"t
          need the local Administrators rights.
