            Netwrix Auditor uses SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) to generate reports. In
            environments with Auditor and SSRS installed on different servers, it is recommended to
            use a secure communication channel. This article covers the steps to implement a
            certificate issued by a third-party certification authority (CA) or your internal
            company CA to use in SSRS.

            CA provides you with a certificate to add to the certificate store on the SSRS server.
            Ensure the root certificate of the CA is present in the certificate store. While global
            CA root certificates are updated automatically using Windows Update, publish the root
            certificate manually in case your company has its CA:

            CA provides you with a security certificate that should be added to the certificate
            repository on the SSRS server. Ensure that the root certificate of the CA is present in
            the certificate store. While global CA root certificates are updated automatically using
            Windows Update, publish the root certificate manually in case your company has its CA:
