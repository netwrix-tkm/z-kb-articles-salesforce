        <div>
          <p>
            Why does the <b>Azure AD Accounts — Attributes</b> report show security groups
            membership (the <b>Member of</b> attribute) for an account in the format
            <strong>XXX and more</strong> instead of the full groups list?
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            In short, the answer is lack of space on the report page. Since there are a lot of
            groups those users are members of, the report does not have enough space to show all of
            them.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, as an alternative, you can use the
            <b>Azure AD Accounts - Effective Group Membership</b> report along with the
            <b>Azure AD Accounts – Attributes</b> reports.
          </p>

          <p>
            The thing is that when you click the <strong>Expand Group Membership</strong> link in
            the <b>Azure AD Accounts - Attributes</b> report, it basically redirects you to the
            information from the <b>Azure AD Accounts - Effective Group Membership</b> report.
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore, by using both reports simultaneously, we will be able to check the effective
            group membership information from the other report (<strong
              >Azure AD Accounts - Effective Group Membership</strong
            >) which would have the full list of the groups an account is a member of.
          </p>
