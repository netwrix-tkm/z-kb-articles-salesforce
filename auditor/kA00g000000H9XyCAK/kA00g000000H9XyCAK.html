        <hr />

        The <strong>Calendar</strong> folder is excluded from auditing by default, because users
        often share their calendars. Access to a shared mailbox folder by non-owners will be
        qualified as unauthorized non-owner access to the mailbox by the product.

        <hr />

        If you still want to monitor the <strong>Calendar</strong> folder, do the following:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Navigate to the NetWrix Non-Owner Mailbox Access Reporter for Exchange installation
            directory.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open the <span>mailboxestoexclude.txt</span> file and delete the */calendar* line.
          </li>
          <li>Save the changes.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
