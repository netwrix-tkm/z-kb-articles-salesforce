          <div>
            <p>
              You get these events from your Netwrix Auditor Server because during the data
              collection, Netwrix Auditor for File Servers or Windows Servers reads the list of
              shared objects which triggers events 5140.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>

          <div>
            <p>
              This event is being generated for each attempt to access a file share within a network
              that is considered as normal behavior according to Microsoft.
