        Can I export information on account lockout events for audit purposes?

        <hr />

        NetWrix Account Lockout Examiner console does not have the Export feature. However all
        lockout information is stored in the <strong>allinfo.xml</strong> file located in the
        product installation directory. It can be easily parsed by third-party tool or script to get
        required information. However account names are not sotred in the allinfo.xml, all accounts
        are referred to as SIDs.

        NetWrix also has another product called NetWrix Event Log Manager for this purpose. This
        product is able to collect event log entries from multiple computers across the network and
        centrally store all events in a central location in a compressed format. For more
        information, refer to the following link:
