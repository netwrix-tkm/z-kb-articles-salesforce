        You are not receiving scheduled reports from Active Directory, Group Policy, Exchange Change
        Reporter and see one of the following symptoms:
        <div>
          1. Session records are not appearing for the days reports are missing in the
          <strong>Netwrix Management Console</strong>(%domain name%&gt;Active DirectoryGroup
          PolicyExchange&gt;Sessions node) and data collection does not start when you click the Run
          button in the <strong>Netwrix Management Console</strong> (%domain name% &gt; right
          pane&gt; Run button) 2.Session records are appearing for the days reports are missing but
          contain warnings in the <strong>Netwrix Management Console</strong>(%domain
          name%&gt;Active DirectoryGroup PolicyExchange&gt;Sessions node), the data collection
          starts when you click the Run button in the
          <strong>Netwrix Management Console</strong> (%domain name% &gt; right pane&gt; Run button)
          but you receive no reports either way.
        </div>
        <div>
          3. Session records are not appearing for the days reports are missing in the
          <strong>Netwrix Management Console</strong>(%domain name%&gt;Active DirectoryGroup
          PolicyExchange&gt;Sessions node), however when you open Task Scheduler the
          <strong
            >NetWrix Management Console " Active Directory Change Reporter - %domain name%</strong
          >
          scheduled task is running and in the Task Manager (Processes tab) you see the
          <strong>ADCR.exe</strong> process.
        </div>

        <hr />

        This issue can be caused for several reasons, depending on the root cause (see the symptoms
        1 " 3 above):
        <ol>
          <li>
            Scheduled task (<strong
              >NetWrix Management Console " Active Directory Change Reporter - %domain name%</strong
            >) cannot start
          </li>
          <li>
            Product cannot send email, or email is being sent but there are issues with delivery (on
            the Exchange side)
          </li>
          <li>The ADCR.exe process hangs.</li>
        </ol>

        <hr />

        Depending on the root cause (see the symptoms 1 " 3 above) do the following: 1. Open Task
        Manager, right click the
        <strong
          >NetWrix Management Console " Active Directory Change Reporter - %domain name% </strong
        >scheduled task and select run. If the task fails to run, open its properties and history
        tab. Review the errors regarding the task launch. If you see the event ID 101 with the
        details outlined below, make sure that password is valid for the service account you
        specified to run the data collection. ---- Task Scheduler failed to start "NetWrix
        Management Console - Active Directory Change Reporter - %domain name%" task for user "domain
        nameaccount name". Additional Data: Error Value: 2147943726. ---- Regarding the other errors
        you may see in the task history tab and please refer to the following Microsoft KB articles:

          target="_blank"
          >http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa383604(v=vs.85).aspx</a
        >
        (NOTE: for this article you may need to convert the error codes from decimal to hexadecimal,
        for that you can use standard Windows Calculator &gt; Programmer view )
        <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc721846(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank"
          >http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc721846(v=ws.10).aspx</a
        >

        2. Open NetWrix Management Console &gt; %domain name% &gt; Active Directory Change Reporter
        &gt; Go to the right pane, select specified recipient and click edit, then click verify.
        After that, use one of the following approaches (depending on the particular case): 2.1
        Email verification test has been failed. Pay attention at the received error message (the
        error code and message are being taken from Exchange server), you may refer to the following
        Microsoft resource to troubleshot the error you received:
        <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/ff396001.aspx" target="_blank"
          >http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/ff396001.aspx</a
        >

        2.2 Email verification test has been passed but a test email has not been delivered to the
        recipient. You can use the Exchange message tracking feature to determine what happens to
        the emails the product sends. For details please refer to the following Microsoft article:
        <a
          href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa997984(v=exchg.141).aspx"
          target="_blank"
          >http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa997984(v=exchg.141).aspx</a
        >

        2.3 Another reason could be the size of the email the product sends, make sure your Exchange
        server is configured to allow messages with the size of 20 mb to be sent, for more details
        please refer to the following Microsoft kb article:
        <a
          href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb124345(v=exchg.141).aspx"
          target="_blank"
          >http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb124345(v=exchg.141).aspx</a
        >

        2.4 If you are using a distribution group to deliver product reports to recipients please
        refer to the following KB article:
        <a href="http://www.netwrix.com/kb/1646" target="_blank">http://www.netwrix.com/kb/1646</a>

        3. The ADCR.exe process hanging could be caused for different reasons, such as corrupted
        Security event log on one of the managed domain controllers, connectivity issues and some
        others. If your symptoms indicate that the ADCR.exe process is hanging (see the symptom 3
        above) please gather diagnostic information listed below and contact Netwrix technical
        support: 3.1 Enable diagnostic logging
        <ul>
          <li>
            Open registry editor and navigate to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodeNetWrixAD
            Change Reporter registry hive
          </li>
          <li>Right click the TraceLevel registry key and set its value to 31 (decimal)</li>
        </ul>
        3.2 Reproduce the issue
        <ul>
          <li>

            process has been terminated
          </li>
          <li>Open Netwrix Management console and run the data collection</li>
          <li>
            Wait until the issue has been reproduced (wait at least 18 hours to confirm that report
            has not been delivered and symptoms are indicative that ADCR.exe is hanging)
          </li>
        </ul>
        3.3 Open support ticket on the Netwrix support portal (<a
