          <p>
            Your Netwrix Auditor license has recently expired − a new license has since been
            applied. Why do activity records from the downtime period are missing?
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            Netwrix Auditor stops monitoring corresponding data sources after the license
            expiration. Once a new license is applied, Auditor will collect all the data present in
            event logs as of the moment of the license application. This behavior is expected − the
            event logs are set up to be overwritten to prevent the extra space consumption. Any
            events that were overwritten will not have activity records generated for them.
          </p>

          <p>
            Depending on the size of your environment and the amount of Activity Records generated
            per day, you might need to increase the event log size. Refer to the following article
            for additional information:
