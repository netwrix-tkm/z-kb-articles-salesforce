        You have configured change auditing in accordance with the Installation and Configuration
        guide (<a
          href="http://www.netwrix.com/download/documents/NetWrix_Active_Directory_Change_Reporter_Installation_Configuration_Guide.pdf"
          target="_blank"
          >Installation and Configuration Guide</a
        >), however auditing policies are not being applied and Active Directory Change Reporter
        keep complaining about audit settings on all or some domain controllers. In addition to this
        all or some changes in summary reports are listed as made by the System account.

        <hr />

        The reasons why the auditing policies are not being enabled on domain controllers in the
        managed domain may be:
        <ol>
          <li>
            GPO you configured auditing policies in is not being distributed to problematic domain
            controllers
          </li>
          <li>
            GPO you configured auditing policies in is being distributed to problematic domain
            controllers but auditing policies are not being applied
          </li>
        </ol>

        <hr />

        <ol>
          <li>
            Make sure the GPO you configured auditing policies in is being distributed to
            problematic domain controllers. For that please use Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP)
            <a

          </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Log onto the domain controller which Active Directory Change Reporter is complaining
            about
          </li>
          <li>
            Run Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP): Start&gt;Run&gt; type rsop.msc and press enter
          </li>
          <li>
            Expand Audit Policy as shown on the picture bellow and make sure you see the
            corresponding source GPO (the GPO which you enabled auditing policies in) for auditing
            polices and ensure no warnings and errors. In our case we see that Audit Account
            Management policy is set to Failure, while for successful auditing we need to have this
            policy set to Success.

          </li>
          <li>
            To fix this problem open Group Policy Management Console (Start&gt;Administrative
            tools&gt;Group Policy Management), select Domain Controllers node, Open the Group Policy
            Inheritance tab and in the right pane review the order the GPOs are being applied to the
            Domain Controllers OU. In our case the Default Domain Policy is enforced and being
            applied first which causes a GPO conflict. Manage your GPOs inheritance to exclude the
            necessary policy settings to be applied. For more details regarding GPO inheritance
            please refer to the following Microsoft kb article:

              If you resolved the inheritance issue and corresponding GPOs are being distributed to
              problematic domain controller but Active Directory Change Reporter still complains on
              Auditing settings this may indicate that Auditing policy settings are not being
              applied on a domain controller. To troubleshot this you can use Local Group Policy
              Editor:
              <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731745.aspx" target="_blank"
                >http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc731745.aspx</a

          </ol>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Log onto the domain controller which Active Directory Change Reporter is complaining
              about.
            </li>
            <li>Open Local Group Policy Editor: Start&gt;Run&gt;Secpol.msc</li>
            <li>
              Expand Audit Policy as shown on the picture bellow and make sure that the necessary
              auditing policies are set to success (Audit Account Management, Audit Directory
              Service Access ) and equal to ones you see in Run Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div />
        </div>

        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the Local Group Policy Editor indicates different auditing setting (different from
              ones you configured and see in Resultant Set of Policy (RSoP)) this may indicate an
              issue with GPO applying on that particular domain controller. To troubleshooting this
              issue please refer to the following Microsoft kb articles:
