        <div>
          <p>
            Is Netwrix Auditor able to show data collected from one of several replicated Domain
            Controllers in search, reports, alerts, and emails?
          </p>

          <p>Example deployment scenario:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                There are two Domain Controllers within a domain. The replication configured
                successfully between these Domain Controllers, and neither one is read-only.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                A monitoring plan is configured to collect data
                <b>only from a single Domain Controller</b>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>

        <h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            Yes, Netwrix Auditor can show these events with some considerations.<br />Netwrix
            collects data, including but not limited to Windows Security Event Logs that are not
            replicated from one Domain Controller to another. Even if an action itself was
            replicated, the product will not be able to show correctly all issue details in search,
            reports, alerts, and emails since event log entries are not replicated. Review the
            following for additional information:
