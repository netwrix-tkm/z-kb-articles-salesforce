          Netwrix Auditor comes installed with three additional programs that provide additional
          avenues of auditing. Navigating to the Data Collection Account credentials will be the
          same for all three. Find the programs via the Start Menu &gt; Select a Monitoring Plan
          &gt; Click "Edit".

        <p>
          <b>Note:</b> If you do not have any monitoring plans for these programs, you may skip this
          step.

        <p>
          If you are still receiving failed logons and/or lockouts for your Netwrix Auditor Data
          Collection Account, please consider the following:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Confirm that no other applications are using the same account as a service account (i.e.
            Back up software, Virus Scanners, etc.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Stop Netwrix Services for a frame of time. Take note of the window of which the services
            are stopped. Once services are running again, allow some time for data to upload to SQL.
            After waiting, run a search like the one below:
          </li>
        </ul>
        <img
          class="wp-image-3808 hoverZoomLink"

          src="https://kb.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Search-for-DCA-1024x409.png"
        />
        <ul>
          <li>
            If any failed logons and/or lockouts are reported for the Data Collection Account,
            Netwrix is certainly not the root cause.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lastly, Technical Support is equipped to assist in cases where the proposed solutions
            above do not resolve the issue.
          </li>
        </ul>
