        Account Lockout Examiner does not notify about account lockouts although Notifications are
        enabled.

        <hr />

        An e-mail notification is sent only when an actual lockout security event is tracked. There
        are two possible reasons why notifications typically are not sent - either lockout is not
        tracked, or there are some errors during sending of the notification.

        <hr />

        To make sure that an actual lockout event is tracked, make sure that the lockout timestamp
        is correct. If it is not, then please refer to the following KB article
        <a href="https://kb.netwrix.com/2763" target="_blank">https://kb.netwrix.com/2763</a>

        If the lockout timestamp is correct, then a notification should be sent. First of all make
        sure all settings are correct:
        <ol>
          <li>Go to File " Settings " Notifications</li>
          <li>Check mail server address and port.</li>
          <li>
            Your mailserver should accept anonymous SMTP connections. Test with telnet if it is
            possible to connect on the specified port.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure that there is no firewall or antivirus software blocking inbound and outbound
            connections
          </li>
        </ol>
        If all the settings are correct, then the easiest way to find out the error is to review the
        product log. NOTE. If you have a valid support contract you can submit a support ticket and
        send the log to Netwrix Support. By default it is located in C:Program Files
        (x86)NetWrixAccount Lockout ExaminerTracingALEService.log Scroll to the very bottom and
        search for the "NOTIFICATIONS" text in the Up direction. NOTE. Messages of Notification type
        are logged only in case an error occurred. If there are no such messages, than either there
        were no errors during notification sending, or the product did not try to send it at all -
        there were no lockout events tracked. When you find the corresponding "NOTIFICATIONS"
        message, the error message is listed in the second line, for example:
        <div>
          <strong
            >ALEService.exe Warning: 0 : [TID, &lt;timestamp&gt;] NOTIFICATIONS: smtpserver:
