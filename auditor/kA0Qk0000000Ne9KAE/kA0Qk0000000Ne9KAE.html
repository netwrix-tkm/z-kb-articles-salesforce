            Why does the Netwrix Auditor Application Deployment Service not start or is terminated
            upon launch?

        <h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            There are some Netwrix services that are not shown in <b>services.msc</b> snap-in. They
            run as processes and disappear when finished. For example, the processes to audit
            <b>Windows File Server</b> and <b>Logon Activity</b>.
          </p>

          <p>
            A parent service called <b>Netwrix Auditor Application Deployment Service</b> manages
            them. When you enable a compression service, the Application Deployment service is
            installed on the target server. Then, the Application Deployment service helps deploying
            the compression services ("processes") and manages them. Once the Application Deployment
            service completes its tasks, such as installing the compression service on the target,
            it goes into idle mode. When needed again, it starts automatically.
          </p>

          <p>
            Therefore, there is no need to manually start this service or worry if the service gets
            stopped.
