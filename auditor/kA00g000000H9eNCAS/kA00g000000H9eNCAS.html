        <p>
          Netwrix Auditor for Logon Activity may report a large amount of failed logons from a
          single workstation or server.
        </p>

        <h2 id="cause">Cause</h2>

        <p>
          Usually, this happens because the problematic account credentials were saved somewhere on
          the target machine and became outdated. If a user's password had been changed but it was
          not updated in the system or application that had been using it, this systems/application
          will try to use the stored outdated credentials, therefore generating a large amount of
          failed logons.
        </p>

        <p>
          Login to the originating machine and check the following systems for outdated credentials:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Windows Ð¡redential Manager </strong>- may store outdated credentials.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Windows task scheduler </strong>- there could be a task configured to run using
            the problematic account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Application or service</strong> - there could be a service that is trying to
            start or a tool/application that is trying to run using outdated credentials.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Terminal Server session</strong> - there could be an opened session with
            outdated credentials.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>AD Federation Services </strong>- replication issues - a new password was not
            replicated to ADFS.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>DCOM objects </strong>- sometimes a computer requires a restart after changing
            user password - to apply setting to DCOM objects that are using these credentials.
          </li>
        </ul>
