        <ol>
          <li>
            When removing Item, Data Source or Monitoring Plan from Netwrix Auditor, it's
            Compression Service Agents are not removed automatically from the Servers that are no
            longer being monitored.
          </li>
          <li>
            After the upgrade of Netwrix Auditor, there are errors in Health Log that indicate that
            Compression Service Agents cannot be updated automatically.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="causes">Causes</h2>
        Installation - Possible causes for an issue during installation are: there is a previous
        version of the Compression Service that cannot be uninstalled correctly, OS settings prevent
        installation of .msi package (e.g. Domain Policies, no permissions for Netwrix Account)<br />Uninstllation
        - Possible causes for an issue during removal are: Missing/corrupt installation package,
        corrupt registry keys that point to a nonexistent folder.
        <h2 id="solution">Solution</h2>
        In this case, the Agents must be removed manually. Netwrix Auditor uses standard .msi
        packages to deploy its Compression Service Agents. In order to remove them, we recommend
        using Troubleshooting Software provided by Microsoft here:

        ><br /><br /><b>NOTE:</b> All operations must be done on the <b>Target </b>server, not on
        the server where Netwrix Auditor is installed. If there are multiple affected Target
        servers, the operation must be done on each one of them separately.<br /><br />There are two
        possible scenarios:

          The agent cannot be installed on the target host
        </h3>

        <ol>
          <li>Run the <b>troubleshooter </b>program that was downloaded form Microsoft Website</li>
          <li>click <b>Next </b>and select <b>Uninstalling </b>option,</li>
          <li>
            find and select the corresponding name of the Compression Service Agent in the list and
            follow the steps to complete the procedure.
          </li>
          <li>
            If data collection with compression service is enabled for this server, Compression
            Service will then be automatically installed by Auditor.
          </li>
        </ol>
        If the agent name is not in the list, then run the troubleshooter again and select
        <b>Installing </b>option, select the name of the agent in the list and complete the
        procedure.
