          What to expect from Netwrix Auditor logs
        </h4>

        <p>
          Logs can reveal many aspects of operations for all Netwrix Auditor Collectors and
          Services. Not all log information is related to errors, in fact most of the text will walk
          you through the collection process.
        </p>

        <h4 id="where_are_the_logs">Where are the logs?</h4>

        <p>
          The Netwrix Auditor Logs can be found by default at "C:ProgramDataNetwrix AuditorLogs" on
          the Netwrix Auditor Server.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is certainly an overwhelming amount of logs to choose from. To efficiently view
          logs, first choose which collector you would like to troubleshoot or investigate. Most log
          folders display the name of the related collector. Some logs are nested and may take
          longer to find unless you build familiarity with the file structure.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Data Collection Core</strong><br />This is an example of a less obvious log
          location. This directory has logs for collectors like File Server Auditing and Logon
          Activity.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Audit Core</strong><br />This directory will include logs for Netwrix Auditor Core
          Services. For example, Technical Support will visit these logs in instances where data may
          not be getting stored in SQL. In this example, we would look at the NwArchiveSVC because
          the Netwrix Auditor Archive Service is responsible for storing data in SQL.
        </p>

        <h4 id="how_to_read_the_logs">How to read the logs</h4>

        <p>
          Due to variance between logs, the general rule of thumb when viewing logs is to start with
          the largest sized log. Alternatively, you can choose to start with log files with names
          that match the collector in question. In this example, they are one in the same:

          alt=""
        />

        <hr class="wp-block-separator" />

        <p>
          Once you open a log, you will want to either scroll to the bottom or use the handy
          keystroke CONTROL + END<br />Log data is formatted in columns. From left to right, data is
          presented as: Date/Time, Message Type, Process Code, Process Name, Process
          description/Error Description
        </p>

        <img
          class="wp-image-4640"
          src="https://kb.netwrix.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/reading-log-data-1-1024x147.png"
          alt=""
        />

        <p>
          Unless you are viewing logs to better understand collector processes, you will want to
          filter through the log using a find function. Here are useful ways to find errors and
          warnings
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Control + F</strong></li>
          <li>warn</li>
          <li>err</li>
          <li>error</li>
          <li>failed</li>
          <li>
            tracing (This may not be present in every log, but if it is, you can see when a
            collection begins, follow it through, and watch for signs of root cause)
          </li>
          <li>
            names of servers and domain controllers (If you suspect issues with collections from
            identified machines, you may find clues by searching their names in the logs)
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Ultimately, learning logs requires the ability to watch for patterns. While extremely
          useful, logs will not always lead to a direct resolution. They tend to act as a stepping
          stone along the path to resolution.
        </p>

        <h4 id="sending_logs_to_technical_support">Sending logs to Technical Support</h4>

        <p>
          In most cases, Technical Support will request logs for tickets not resolved on initial
          contact. If you would like to anticipate this and possibly expedite resolution, you can
          prepare the logs using the steps seen
