        The status of your collections show as Not Scheduled after creation. Following the
        instructions in the description does not help.

        <hr />

        Something is blocking the creation of the Windows Scheduled Task. This could be permissions
        of some kind, group policy or UAC.

        <hr />

        To ensure that the following KB will be helpful please verify the following: 1) There is a
        scheduled task created in the C:WindowsTasks folder however the Windows Task Scheduler GUI
        does not show this task. Once that is confirmed please try the following. After each step
        where a change was made, refresh Windows Task Scheduler to see if the task shows up. 1)
        Ensure the Data Processing Account is a local admin and/or disable UAC on the Netwrix
        Server. 2) Ensure that credentials that are entered in <strong>Settings -&gt; </strong
        ><strong>Data Collection -&gt; Modify Button </strong>are not blank. 3)
        <strong>Right click </strong>each of your managed objects and for each one that is using
        <strong>custom credentials</strong> also make sure that those are not blank. 4) Ensure that
        the following <strong>Group Policy</strong> is not applied to the Netwrix server -<strong>
          Network access: Do not allow storage of passwords and credentials for network
          authentication</strong
        >. You can see if it is by opening <strong>Local Security Policy</strong> and navigating to
        <strong>Security Settings -&gt; Local Policies -&gt; Security Option</strong>s. Note #2 and
        #3 are more likely to occur after a migration as the credentials are encrypted specifically
        for the original computer and need to be entered manually.
