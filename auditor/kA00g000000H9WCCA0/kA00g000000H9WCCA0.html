        How to reset the Generic Event (Event Log Management) collections in order to collect data
        that had been collected in the past.

        <hr />

        In cases where Netwrix Auditor - Generic Events (Event Log Management) is not being used to
        archive event data but rather collect it "on demand" you must remove prior collection
        history for the server you are trying to collect from so that event logs are collected that
        were already collected in the past.<br /><br />In order to do this please perform the
        following:<br /><br />1) Navigate to the <strong>audit archive</strong> location (location
        specified under <strong>Settings -&gt; Audit Archive</strong>) and drill down into the
        <strong>Logs</strong> folder. In this folder find the
        <strong>name of the Managed Object</strong> and inside that there is a folder for
        <strong>each of the computers</strong> the product is collecting from.
        <strong>Delete</strong> the folder for the computer in question.
