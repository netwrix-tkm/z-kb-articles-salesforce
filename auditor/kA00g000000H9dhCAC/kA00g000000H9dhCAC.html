                Netwrix Auditor is set to monitor several domains in the same forest, e.g. one root
                and several child domains.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The configuration or schema has been changed for one of the child domains. Netwrix
                Auditor reported several types of configuration changes in separate change reports
                for each of the monitored domains.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Only one report indicates the specific WHO that changed the configuration, while
                    other reports state System in the WHO field.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>

        <h2 id="cause_and_resolution">Cause and Resolution</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            This behavior is expected due to the Active Directory architecture. Configuration and
            Schema partitions are shared between all domains in the forest. Changes made to these
            partitions in one domain are replicated to other domains.<br />Security log events that
            Netwrix uses to establish the WHO value are only generated in the domain where the
            changes were actually made. For all other domains the reports will show
            <strong>System</strong>.<br /><br />Netwrix Auditor exclusively collects events from
            domain controllers in domains specified for data collection (in addition to domain
            controllers in the root domain) and ignores domain controllers in the domains that are
            not audited. Netwrix Auditor collects changes and security events separately and
            independently for each managed domain. In the example above, each domain had
            configuration changes due to replication, but only one had corresponding security events
            which Netwrix Auditor used to collect the WHO value.
