        You have configured Database Content Audit in Netwrix Auditor for SQL Servers and ran a
        collection and DB_OWNER has been removed from your databases.
        <hr />
        <div>
          When the Database Content Audit option is selected, on each data collection the program
          checks if the TRUSTWORTHY property is enabled on the monitored databases, and enables the
          property when it is disabled. Sometimes this process can corrupt the database owner
          record.
        </div>

        <hr />
        <div>
          In Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, run the following command: "ALTER AUTHORIZATION
          ON DATABASE::db_name TO user_name" where "db_name" is a name of the corrupted database and
          "user_name" is the db owner account name.
