          User Behavior Analytics (UBA) is a feature that is currently in a closed enrollment stage.
          Here is an excerpt taken from the Netwrix Auditor 9.9 Installation and Configuration
          Guide:

        <p>
          "Netwrix Behavior Anomaly Insight is an advanced cloud-based module of Netwrix Auditor
          solution that enables you to detect behavior anomalies in your IT environment, such as
          activity surges or mass deletions of archived data. As you investigate suspicious activity
          and review incidents, you can identify intruders or in-house actors who keep violating
          your company's security policies. The behavior anomalies assessment provides both a
          high-level visualization and a detailed history of malicious user activity. It accumulates
          historical data over time and gives you a bird's eye view on the activity patterns. With
          Netwrix Behavior Anomaly Insight you can step beyond individual actions and investigate
          more complicated user behavior scenarios that might otherwise stay concealed for a long
          time."
