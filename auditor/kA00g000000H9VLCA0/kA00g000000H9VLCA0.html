        When a file/folder is moved how does Netwrix Auditor - Fileserver report this?

        <hr />

        The following explains how the audit trail appears when a folder or file is moved FROM an
        audited location TO an audited location. If the file/folder is moved to a location that is
        not Audited there will be NO audit trail other than the Removal from the original location.
        The behavior is depend on<b> Audit trail settings</b>:<br /><br />In
        <b>Basic mode</b>:<br />File/Folder <span>Removed</span> from original location<br />File/Folder
        <span>Added</span> to new location - but this depends on several conditions, like
        applications or methods used for moving the object.<br /><br />In<b> Enhanced mode</b
        >:<br />File/Folder<span> Removed</span> from original location<br />File/Folder<span
        > </span><span>Modified </span>in new location<br /><br />In Netwrix Auditor 9.0 and newer
        file/folder moves are reported properly.
