            In some cases, you may need to add space to the Long-Term Archive. Please follow the
            steps below to enhance your archive capacity.

            <strong>Long-Term Archive</strong> is a file-based storage where Netwrix Auditor saves
            the collected activity records. By default, it is located on the system drive at
            <em>%PROGRAMDATA%\Netwrix Auditor\Data</em> and keeps data for <strong>120</strong>
            <strong>months (10 years) </strong>. The product informs you if you are running out of
            space on a system disk where it is stored.<br /><br />There is a <strong
              >Long-Term Archive</strong
            > widget that helps you to monitor the Long-Term Archive capacity. The widget can be
            found by clicking the <strong>Health Status</strong> tile on the Netwrix Auditor home
            screen. It displays the current size and daily increase of the Long-Term Archive as well
            as the remaining free space on the target drive. <br /><br />Once the free disk space
            starts approaching the minimum level, you will see events in the
            <strong>Netwrix Auditor System Health</strong> log. When the free disk space is less
            than <strong>3 GB</strong>, the Netwrix services responsible for audit data collection
            will be stopped, which means that data collection also stops.
          </p>

          <p>
            Typically, Netwrix recommends adding space (150-200 GB) to the drive where the Long-Term
            Archive resides to resolve the issue. Follow the steps below to find where your
            Long-Term Arvice data is stored.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>In Netwrix Auditor, navigate to <b>Settings</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Select the <b>Long-Term Archive</b> page and review where your audit data is
                written. You can modify the archive retention settings here, however, read the steps
                below for the correct procedure.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            In this scenario, all historical data collected by the product will be preserved. If you
            do not have enough hardware resources for that, add some space (recommended 25-30 GB) on
            the Auditor Server host to restore regular product functionality and then decrease the
            retention period of the archive.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <span><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong></span> After changing the retention, for example to
              1 year, all data older than 1 year will be removed (it might take up to several days)
              and that freed up even more disk space.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>Follow the steps below to decrease the retention period for the archive:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Add some space (25-30GB) on the Auditor Server.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Shortly after adding additional space, start all Netwrix services.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Immediately after that, decrease the Long-Term Archive retention. For that, navigate
                to the Auditor settings -&gt; <b>Long-Term Archive</b> and click <b>Modify</b> under
                the Long-term Archive. Then provide a new retention value in months.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            It is up to you to decide how long you want to keep historical data. If you know that no
            historical data will be needed past one year, decrease the retention to
            <b>12 months</b>. The historical data can be imported from the Archive back to your
            Audit Database when needed via the <b>Investigations</b> feature.
