        This article explains how to set up a response action in Netwrix Auditor alert to move an AD
        user account to the quarantine Organizational Unit (OU). Read more about alert response
        action settings in the

          >Administration – Alerts – Configure a Response Action for Alert ⸱ v10.6</a
        > article.<br />A quarantine OU is an OU with restrictive policies applied, used to limit
        access to sensitive and business-critical resources. Removal of a significant number of
        files from a file server within a short period of time may indicate potentially harmful user
        activity. To mitigate the risks of account usage with malicious intent, it is recommended to
        move suspicious user accounts to the quarantine OU. With this measure, you can limit user
        privileges without deleting the account from Active Directory. With Netwrix Auditor alerting
        and response action feature, you can automate and verify this course of action. To simulate
        suspicious activity and trigger the response action, you can do the following:
        <blockquote>
          <div>
            <span><strong>IMPORTANT</strong></span
            >. It is strongly recommended that before implementing this course of action in your
            production environment, you perform these steps in your test lab. Please also note that
            we are only performing the moving action, creating/designating a Quarantine OU is not
            included in this procedure.
          </div>
        </blockquote>
        <strong>Step 1.</strong> Check prerequisites and take preparatory steps, as described
        below.<br /><strong>Step 2.</strong> Modify the PowerShell script provided later in this
        document and save it to Netwrix Auditor server.<br /><strong>Step 3.</strong> Enable the
        <strong>Mass Data Removal from File Servers</strong> alert in Netwrix Auditor and configure
        response action for this alert to run the PowerShell script.<br /><strong>Step 4.</strong>
        On your file server, create 10+ files, then remove these files using test AD user
        account.<br /><strong>Step 5.</strong> Wait for notification on the alert triggering and
        check response action results in the Active Directory Users and Computers.

        <h4 id="step_1_check_prerequisites">Step 1. Check Prerequisites</h4>
        Make sure the following is present in the test AD domain:

        <ul>
          <li>Test AD user account</li>
          <li>Quarantine OU</li>
          <li>
            A privileged account with sufficient rights to move AD users to the quarantine OU " you
            may need a domain administrator account for that purpose.
          </li>
        </ul>
        On Netwrix Auditor server, check the following:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Active Directory Module for Windows PowerShell</strong> is installed and
            enabled. For example, to enable this module on Windows Server 2016:
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
          <li>Go to Server Manager, click <strong>Manage</strong>.</li>
          <li>
            Select <strong>Features</strong> &gt;
            <strong>Remote Server Administration Tools</strong> &gt;
            <strong>Role Administration Tools</strong> &gt;
            <strong>AD DS &amp; AD LDS Tools</strong> &gt;
            <strong>Active Directory module for Windows PowerShell</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>Complete the wizard to save the settings.</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The file server you want to monitor for file deletions is included in the corresponding
            monitoring plan; data collection is enabled, and audit data is stored to the database.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="step_2_prepare_a_powershell_script">Step 2. Prepare a PowerShell Script</h4>

        <ol>
          <li>
            With a plain text editor (e.g. Notepad), copy the script content provided below; in the
            <strong>$OUTargetPath</strong> parameter specify the distinguished name of your
            quarantine OU (the name to modify is colored <span>red</span>).

            <pre><span><span><span><span>#Target OU
$OUTargetPath = "<span>OU=q,DC=DC11,DC=Loc</span>"
$PathToCSV = "$Args"
$scriptdir=$PSScriptRoot
$PathToResultFile = Join-Path $scriptdir "result"
$PathToResultFile = (Copy-Item -Path $PathToCSV -Destination $PathToResultFile -PassThru)
$csv = Import-Csv -Path $PathToResultFile -Delimiter "`t"

$Who = $csv | Select Who| Sort-Object -Property Who -Unique

foreach ($item in $Who)
{
  Move-ADObject (Get-ADUser -Identity ((New-Object System.Security.Principal.NTAccount($item."Who")).Translate([System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier])).Value).DistinguishedName -TargetPath $OUTargetPath
}</span></span></span></span>
</pre>
          </li>
          <li>
            Save the customized script as a <em>.PS1</em> file in a folder on Netwrix Auditor
            server.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="step_3_configure_the_alert">Step 3. Configure the Alert</h4>

        <ol>
          <li>
            In Netwrix Auditor, go to <strong>Alerts</strong> and select
            <strong>Mass Data Removal from File Servers</strong>
          </li>
          <li>On the <strong>General</strong> tab, turn alerting on.</li>
          <li>
            On the <strong>Recipients</strong> tab, specify your email address to get a notification

          </li>
          <li>
            On the <strong>Filters</strong> tabs, in the <strong>Where</strong> field, specify the
            name of file server you will be monitoring:<br />
            <img
              alt="response_action_filter.png"
              src="kA00g000000H9dtCAC_eff61e07-edc3-4ed1-bdb4-9cd73d589970.png"
            />
          </li>
          <li>
            On the <strong>Thresholds</strong> tab, leave the default values " the alert will be
            triggered if <em>10+</em> files are created by the same user within
            <em>600</em> seconds.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the <strong>Response Action</strong> tab, do the following:
            <ul>
              <li>Enable the response action by switching the slider ON.</li>
              <li>
                In the <strong>Run</strong> field, specify the path to the executable file as in
                your system " in our example this is
                <em>C:WindowsSystem32WindowsPowerShell1.0powershell.exe</em>.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the <strong>With parameters</strong> field, enter: -command
                &lt;path_to_PS1_file&gt; here path_to_PS1_file is the path to PowerShell script you
                prepared at Step 2.
              </li>
              <li>Leave the <strong>Working directory</strong> field as is.</li>
              <li>
                Select <strong>Write data to CSV file</strong> option, leave
                <strong>Limit row count</strong> as is.
              </li>
              <li>
                Select <strong>Use custom credentials</strong> and enter the account that will be
                used to move the suspicious user to the quarantine OU (see Step 1, #3). In our
                example, this is <em>dc11administrator</em>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="step_4_create_and_delete_files">Step 4. Create and Delete Files</h4>

        <ol>
          <li>
            On the file server, create 10 or more files. (To access the file server, use any account
            with sufficient rights - (other than test AD user account).
          </li>
          <li>
            On Netwrix Auditor server, update the related monitoring plan to collect the latest
            audit data (alternatively, you can wait about 10 minutes for automatic data collection
            to complete).
          </li>
          <li>
            Then use test AD user account to delete these files; this operation should not take more
            than 600 seconds (for the alert to be triggered).
          </li>
          <li>
            Back on the Netwrix Auditor server, update the related monitoring plan to collect the
            latest audit data. After it is collected, monitoring plan status will change from
            <em>Working</em> to <em>Enabled</em>.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h4 id="step_5_verify_response_action_results">Step 5. Verify Response Action Results</h4>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Open the mailbox of the alert recipient you specified at Step 3 and make sure the
            notification on the "Mass Data Removal from File Servers" alert was received.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the domain admin account to log on to domain controller, open
            <strong>Users and Computers</strong> snap-in and check that test AD user account is now
            in the quarantine OU.
          </li>
        </ol>

            >. You may need to wait several minutes until moving to the quarantine OU completes.
            After verifying this course of action in your lab, you can implement it in the
            production environment, skipping Step 4 (simulation of suspicious actions).
