          file stored at <strong>C:ProgramDataNetWrixInactive Users Tracker</strong>. This happens
          to prevent automatic changing of the inactive user password every time the product runs.
          This user account will be shown in a report next time when any new action is performed on
          it (such as move to OU, disable and so on).</span
