        <div>
          <p>
            The Overview dashboard shows data, but when drilling down to a report, it says
            <strong>no data found</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            When trying to upload a State-in-Time snapshot manually, the following error appears:
          </p>

          <div>
            <pre class="has-inner-focus">
 
Cannot apply changes.
Error saving the Active Directory state-in-time snapshot to Audit Database: An item with the same key has already been added.

        <h2 id="cause">Cause</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            There are duplicated items in the monitored environment which led to "mangled" entries.
          </p>

          <p>
            It is not the only possible root cause, but it is becoming increasingly more common,
            especially in customer environments with several organizations within Active Directory
            or hybridized environments.
          </p>

        <h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            Review the following Microsoft article that describes how these "mangled" entries are
            handled by the system, how to find them, and how to fix the duplicates:
