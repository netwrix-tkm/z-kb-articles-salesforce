        The summary report contains a change to an object titled
        "rRASAdministrationConnectionPoint". Computer objects have an Object Type of
        "RRAS-Administration-Connection-Point" that is named "RouterIdentity" attached to them
        (RouterIdentity is a visible container in ADSIEdit under the computer object). The computer
        objects cannot be deleted.

        <hr />

        This could be caused from the use of the Routing and Remote Access service; if the Routing
        and Remote Access Service runs it stores information in AD as a child object under the
        particular computer that hosts the RRAS service. Check to see if the affected computers have
        the Routing and Remote Access Service running. It may be a printer or something similar that
        is installed from the computers in question and published in AD. Again if this is the case,
        the Delete Subtree resolution below should resolve the inability to delete the computer
        objects. Using ADUC, from the View menu; select the option for "Users, Groups, and Computers
        as Containers". This will show items that are usually objects as containers (similar to an
        OU). From there you can see what objects exist inside that computer's container.

        <hr />

        To delete these objects, the "Delete Subtree" permission on Computer objects in addition to
        the "Delete" permission will be required. The "Delete" permission alone will not work.
