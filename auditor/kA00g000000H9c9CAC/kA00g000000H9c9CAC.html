        You received Group Policy Change Report showing some changes you do not believe you made.
        <hr />
        By default the product is using the most available domain controller for the data
        collection. On some of the domain controllers Group Policy replication may not occur
        correctly. The product may connect to the domain controller that has a replication issue
        with regards to Group Policies, hence the outdated information, and gather GPOs that contain
        outdated policy settings. The outdated information in gathered GPOs will be considered as a
        change when comparing to the previous snapshot.
        <hr />
        To prevent this from happening, we recommend using a single domain controller for collecting
        Group Policy changes. In order to check which domain controller is currently used for Group
        Policy changes collection, see this file:
        <strong>%Working Folder%\AD Change Reporter\Omitlists\%domain.name%\dclist.txt</strong>. By
        default %Working Folder% is C:\ProgramData\Netwrix Auditor. If there is more than one DC
        listed in that file, it means that the first DC in the list didn't respond at some point and
        Netwrix had to pick a new one. This could be the reason for fake changes. If you know a DC
        which is highly available and stable, feel free to put its FQDN into that file instead of
        the current ones.
