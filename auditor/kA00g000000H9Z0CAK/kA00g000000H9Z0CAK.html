        Password Expiration email report (being delivered automatically) and Ad-hoc report
        (generated manually) provide a different number of user accounts in the following operating
        environment:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Netwrix Auditor is configured to monitor password expirations in a domain which belongs
            to the forest with one-way trusts established.
          </li>
          <li>
            The password policy in the target domain is set granularly by using the Fine Grained
            Password Policy (FGP)
          </li>
          <li>
            Netwrix Auditor is set to report on users with Fine Grained Policy Settings (the "Only
            report on users with Fine Grained Policy Settings" checkbox is checked )
          </li>
        </ul>

        <hr />

        This could happen because the Data Processing Account that is being used to collect data
        does not have enough permissions to read the Password Settings Container from the target
        domain. While the Ad-Hoc is being run under a different account which can read the Password
        Settings Container

        <hr />

        To check if the Data Processing Account has enough permissions please perform the following
        steps:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Run ADSI Edit as the Data Processing Account (refer to the
            <a href="https://kb.netwrix.com/743" target="_blank">KB</a> if you need to install ADSI
            Edit utility)
          </li>
          <li>Connect to the target domain Default Naming Context</li>
          <li>Navigate to the CN=System</li>
          <li>Try to open CN=Password Settings Container and read the PSO.</li>
        </ul>
        If you do not see the CN=Password Settings Container under the CN=System node or cannot read
        the properties this indicates Data Processing Account does have read rights (see the
        screenshot below: the account does not have rights to access the Password Settings
        Container).

          <img
            src="kA00g000000H9Z0CAK_b812f991-65f8-4c30-a260-6f036fcc9f3e.png"
            alt="User-added image"
            width="500"
            height="229"
          />
        </div>
        To provide read permissions to the Data Processing Account:
        <ul>
          <li>Run ADSI Edit as a domain Administrator</li>
          <li>Connect to the target domain Default Naming Context</li>
          <li>Navigate to the CN=System</li>
          <li>
            Right-click CN=Password Settings Container, select Properties, go to the Security tab
            and add the Data Processing Account and specify Read permissions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Once the read permission for the Data Processing Account is set, verify the access by
        opening the CN=Password Settings Container properties with the Data Processing Account. This
        time you should be able to see CN=Password Settings Container under the CN=System node and
        read its properties (see the screenshot below)
