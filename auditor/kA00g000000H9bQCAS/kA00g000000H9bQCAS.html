        The following error occurs when the enrollment wizard starts: Automatic user enrollment
        failed: Server certificate revocation check failed. (Error Code:12057, URL:
        <a href="https://pmserver/gina_isprofilecreated.asp" target="_blank"
          >https://pmserver/gina_isprofilecreated.asp</a
        >
        Please contact your system administrator if this problem persists.
        <hr />
        The error means that the system was not able to check if the SSL certificate was revoked. In
        case of third-party certificates, it can be caused by firewall or anti-malware software
        blocking connections to revocation servers. Self-signed certificates are usually not checked
        for revocation, however the reason for the issue might be the same - the system cannot reach
        any certificate authority.
        <hr />
        To address the issue:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Make sure firewall or other software is not blocking connection. Enable all connections
            and launch the wizard.
          </li>
          <li>Also make sure that proxy server is not affecting connection</li>
          <li>
            If you use a self-signed certificate - try disabling the proxy and launch the wizard
          </li>
          <li>If the above does not work try disabling revocation check :</li>
        </ol>

        <ul>
          <li>Launch Control panel - Internet options</li>
          <li>Go to Advanced tab</li>
          <li>
            Disable "Check server certificate for revocation" checkbox under Security group of
            settings.
          </li>
        </ul>
