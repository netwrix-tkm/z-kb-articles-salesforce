        You received a Change Summary or a report containing the following warning message:
        <strong
          >"Warning: Collect 'Database' information warning on server: server_name DB: db_name.

        <hr />

        Access to the database is restricted to one user at a time. Netwrix Auditor failed to access
        the database because another user was working with it.

        <hr />

        To change the database access restriction, perform the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Open <strong>Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio</strong> and connect to your server.
          </li>
          <li>
            Navigate to the required database, right-click it and select
            <strong>Properties</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Open the <strong>Options </strong>tab and change the "<strong>Restrict Access</strong>"
            value to "<strong>MULTI_USER</strong>".
          </li>
