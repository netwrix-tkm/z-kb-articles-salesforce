        The following error appears:<br /><em
          >"Collect 'Exchange_Mailbox' information warning on server: %owa server name%. The action
          could not be completed because the Microsoft Exchange Information Store service is
          unavailable. Be sure the service is running and you have network connectivity to the
          Microsoft Exchange Server computer. ..... &lt;List of failed procedures&gt; Microsoft
          Exchange Management Last command: SELECT * FROM Exchange_Mailbox %Date%: Collect
          'Exchange_PublicFolder' information warning on server: %owa server name% The HTTP service
          used by Public Folders is not available, possible causes are that Public stores are not
          mounted and the Information Store service is not running".</em
        ><br />To resolve that issue, make sure the Microsoft Exchange Information Store service is
        running on the target OWA Server. If the issue persists, exclude the required OWA Server
        from data collection by modifying the file called <strong>omitserverlist_ecr.txt</strong>.
        The configuration file is stored in the
        <strong>%Product installation folder%\Active Directory Auditing</strong>. Add one OWA Server
        name per line, for example:<br />OWA-SERVER01<br />OWA-SERVER02
