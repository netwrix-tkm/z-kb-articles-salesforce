          <p>
            Why am I seeing the alert <b>Mass Data Removal from File Servers</b> in Netwrix Auditor,
            alongside the removal and immediate replacement of many files on a DFS file server?
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            This is expected behavior for Netwrix Auditor 10.6.12321 and below. To avoid the issue,
            Netwrix recommends upgrading to the latest version. You can download the latest version
            from the
            <a href="https://www.netwrix.com/my_products.html" target="_blank">My Products</a> page.
          </p>

          <p>For the oldest versions, the workflow is as follows:</p>

          <p>
            In the audited infrastructure with multiple DFS servers, if one server undergoes
            maintenance shutdown while another remains operational, it triggers mass file removal.
          </p>

          <p>
            This removal consequently activates the <b>Mass Data Removal from File Servers</b> alert
            in Netwrix Auditor. Netwrix Auditor interprets the disappearance of files from the
            affected server as a mass creation of file delete Activity Records.
