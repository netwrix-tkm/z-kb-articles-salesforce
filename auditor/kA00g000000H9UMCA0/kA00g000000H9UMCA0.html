        How can I exclude access events to the Calendar folder from the product reports?
        <hr />
        Access events to the Calendar folder are excluded by default (this is set in the
        mailboxestoexclude.txt file located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Netwrix Auditor\Non-owner
        Mailbox Access Reporter for Exchange by default). However, the product only recognizes this
        file if agents are enabled, so make sure that the compression serviceÂ option is enabled.<br /><br /><span

          the mailboxestoexclude.txt file: </span
