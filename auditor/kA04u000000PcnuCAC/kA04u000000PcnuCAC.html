        The next page that appears the the starting page for ALE. Here is a brief description of the
        options available to you.<br /><br /><b>Locked account name - </b>This filed is where you
        will enter the account you wish to examine to discover the source of being locked out.<br /><br /><b
          >Specify examiner credentials</b
        > - The first radial button is selected by default - the "Use current account" option. This
        option will use the currently logged in account as the service account to conduct the
        examination. If you would like to provide another account, choose the second radial button -
        the "Use the following account" option. <b
          >Ensure the account is a member of the Domain Admins group.</b
        ><br /><br /><b>Examine audit trails for the last X days</b> - This field accepts a numeric
        value which will determine how many days backward the examiner will look while parsing
        security event logs. The further back the examination goes, the longer the examination
        process will take.<br /><br />Once the fields above are satisfied, click the "Examine"
        button to begin an examination.<br /><br />For continued use of ALE, save the executable to
        a location such as the desktop. If at anytime you wish to begin a new examination, simply
        re-run the executable.
