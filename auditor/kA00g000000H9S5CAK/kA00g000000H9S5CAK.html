        Sometimes after filling up the space on the system drive your managed objects may disappear.
        The root cause has not yet been determined. For now the best thing to do is to restore the
        NetwrixChangeReporterConfig.xml file from backup. This file can be found in the following
        location by default: C:ProgramDataNetWrixManagement Console. Prior to doing the restore of
        this file please create a support ticket on our Customer Portal and send us a copy of the
        NetwrixChangeReporterConfig.xml file that you have (pre-restore version). This will allow us
        to gather more data to reproduce this issue and understand the root cause. The Customer
        Portal can be found at the following URL:
