        <strong>Netwrix Auditor</strong> uses native Windows tools like
        <strong>Microsoft Group Policy Management </strong>console during the data collection. When
        an issue appears in there it automatically shows up in Netwrix Auditor reports too. For
        example, some Group Policy objects can have an incorrect structure and can not be processed.
        To make sure that this issue relates to Group Policy objects themselves perform following
        steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Click <strong>Start -&gt; Run </strong>and type <strong><em>gpmc.msc </em></strong>on
            the computer where Netwrix Auditor is installed.
          </li>
          <li>Find there any problematic GPO that displayed in report.</li>
          <li>
            Switch to <strong>Settings</strong> tab, right-click and select
            <strong>Save Report</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>The error should occur during this process.</li>
        </ol>

        <hr />

        To troubleshoot this issue, please open problematic GPOs in
        <strong>Microsoft Group Policy Management </strong>console, review settings and fix the
        errors. In some cases, it is not possible to fix these incorrect GPOs and it is recommended
        to recreate them.
