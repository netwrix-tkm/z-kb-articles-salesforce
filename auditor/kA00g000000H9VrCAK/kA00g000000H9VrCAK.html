        How do I get the values of the additional attributes to be displayed in any particular SSRS
        based report.<br /><br />

        <hr />

        It is possible to make some the following reports display the values of the additional
        attributes. Usually the reports are called Modification/Created/Deleted with details. The
        most popular are the following:<br />- All User Changes with Advanced Attributes;<br />-
        User Created with Details;<br />- User Deleted with Details;<br /><br />To do that please
        follow the steps:<br />1. Determine the report you want to show the additional information
        in:<br />a. If you want the "Modification" report to show the additional attributes you need
        - processmodifiedprops.txt file located in the installation folder;<br />b. For "Created"
        reports - processaddedprops.txt;<br />c. For "Deleted" reports - processdeletedprops.txt;<br /><br />2.
        Find out the AD object you are interested in. For example: user, computer, group, etc.<br /><br />3.
        Find out the attribute name you want to be displayed. Like: mail, employeeID, etc. The
        attribute can be found in the Attribute editor in Active Directory Users and Computers
        snap-in. <strong>Note:</strong> it is case sensitive.<br /><br />4. Open the text file
        according to the first step and put the following line: objectType:Attribute:<br />Examples:<br /><img
          alt="Attr"
          src="kA00g000000H9VrCAK_03b43719-5f1d-4d20-968b-0d047659365f.png"
        /><br />NOTE: Each attribute should be put in a separate line. The pound key at the
        beginning of a line means exclusion of the line.
