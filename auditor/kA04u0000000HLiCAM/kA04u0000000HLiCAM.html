          When trying to collect information from Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 (or earlier),
          Netwrix Auditor shows no activity records. There are no errors or warnings in Netwrix
          Health Log.
        </p>

        <h2 id="cause"><span>Cause</span></h2>
        Starting with Netwrix Auditor 10.0, Auditing Exchange for Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 is
        no longer supported. This decision was made in accordance with the decision from Microsoft
        side to
        <a
          href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/exchange-2010-end-of-support?view=o365-worldwide"
          target="_blank"
          >end support for Exchange 2010</a
        >.

        <h2 id="resolution"><span>Resolution</span></h2>
        In order to fix this issue we strongly recommend updating Exchange server to a newer
        version. Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 might contain unknown vulnerabilities and pose a
        threat to the enviroment, as Microsoft doesn't maintain it any longer. If you have Netwrix
        Auditor 9.96 (Build 8412) or older, you will be able to monitor Microsoft Exchange Server
        2010, however in this case we would also recommend upgrading Netwrix Auditor after Exchange
        server has been upgraded.
