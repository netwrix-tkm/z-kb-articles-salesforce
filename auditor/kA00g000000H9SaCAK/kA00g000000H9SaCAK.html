        <h2 id="question">Question</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            Why were changes to Operating System, Operating System Version or Operating System
            Service Pack attributes reported as made by System?
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            This behavior is expected. Changes to the Operating System, Operating System Version and
            Operating System Service Pack attributes are reported as made by System due to the
            Active Directory architecture. Active Directory represented by System relies on
            individual computer accounts to update these attributes on each computer restart.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Active Directory receives the Operating System Version attribute data during the
                communication with a client. This data is then stored in the Active Directory client
                account. Once local changes occur, the client operating system relays new data to
                Active Directory.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If these attributes were changed manually, Netwrix Auditor will report the corresponding
            user account that introduced these changes.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <span><strong>NOTE: </strong></span> Once you restart the client with changed
              attributes, Active Directory represented by System will modify these attributes to be
              reported by System.
            </p>
