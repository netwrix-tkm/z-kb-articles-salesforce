                The <strong>Active Directory Compression Service</strong> starts and stops every 60
                seconds.

                There are many events with ID 7036 stating that the
                <strong>Active Directory Compression Service</strong> entered the Started or Stopped
                state.

            This notification is expected behavior. If you see these information messages, it means
            that the Active Directory collection works correctly. Unfortunately, these notifications
            cannot be stopped as they are hard coded into the Windows System, and it is Windows that
            generates these events.
