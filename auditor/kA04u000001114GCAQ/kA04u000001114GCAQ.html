          <p>
            The same Netwrix Auditor-related executable files are being regularly removed and
            readded to a DC in the environment. The list of files includes
            <code>NwxSaclTunerAgent.exe</code>, <code>NwxNlaAgent.exe</code>, and
            <code>NwxFsAgent.exe</code>. Should this behavior be expected?
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

          <p>
            Yes, this behavior is to be expected — these executable files represent the network
            traffic compression service running on domain controllers. The use of the up-to-date
            version of compression service executables is ensured when copying these files on every
            data collection. The compression service collects and pre-filters data to send it to
            your Netwrix Auditor server in a highly compressed format. For additional information on
            network traffic compression service, refer to the following article:
