        You received a Change Summary containing incorrect data or no data at all and you see the
        following message: Warning: The NetwrixSQLCRAudit database with audit data does not exist or
        cannot be accessed.

        <hr />

        The issue can be caused by the following:
        <ol>
          <li>The database was not created on the monitored server.</li>
          <li>
            The Data Processing Account (DPA) permissions were changed, DPA is account which is used
            to run the data collection of SQL Server auditing.
          </li>
          <li>The database is in the recovery mode.</li>
          <li>
            The account, which is assigned the database owner role of the monitored database, has no
            access to NetwrixSQLCRAudit database.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <hr />

        To fix the issues, do the following:
        <ol>
          <li>Check if the NetwrixSQLCRAudit database exists on the monitored server.</li>
          <li>
            Make sure that the account under which Netwrix SQL Server auditing is running has enough
            privileges on the SQL Server; it has to be assigned the db owner role for this database.
          </li>
          <li>
            Grant all db owners of the monitored databases rights to write into the
            NetWrixSQLCRAudit database. Alternatively, replace all accounts with db owner role by
            the data processing account.
          </li>
        </ol>
