        <div>
          <p>
            The Active Directory state-in-time reports based on historical snapshots do not contain
            data for foreign group members (Foreign security principals).
          </p>

          <h2 id="cause">Cause</h2>

          <div>
            <p>
              An Active Directory domain contains the information about the objects and their
              attributes belonging to this domain. The <b>Group Members</b> report uses a
              cross-domain membership feature, it means that data collected in different monitoring
              plans then aggregated to show the final membership. Thus, the product cannot work with
              historical snapshots, because there is no guarantee that historical snapshots for
              other domains are also uploaded and all of them were taken at the same time, i.e., the
              data from other monitoring plans that could be collected at different time cannot be
              shown in the reports.
            </p>

          <h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>

          <div>
            <p>
              Information about foreign group membersÂ (Foreign security principals) available only
              in the state-in-time reports based on a current session. This is expected behavior of
              the product.
