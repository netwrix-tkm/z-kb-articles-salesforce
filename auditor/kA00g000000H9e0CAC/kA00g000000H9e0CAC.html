        The <b>Netwrix Data Classification</b> platform contains a number of ways to tweak the
        processing of content to make the most of the available server resources and ensure that
        your content is processed as quickly as possible. You may wish to review this guide if:
        <ul>
          <li>
            You're seeing one or two of the core services <strong>idle</strong> a large percentage
            of the time
          </li>
          <li>
            and, one service is typically busy processing content (suggesting a bottleneck with one
            service)
          </li>
        </ul>
        The below guide details some of the typical steps we would recommend taking when looking to
        improve performance, or debug a lower than expected throughput.

        <strong>Collector</strong>

        The <strong>Collector </strong>service is largely bound by the <strong>CPU</strong> and
        <strong>Network </strong>performance available to the server. If these resources are not
        being fully utilised then there are several configuration variables that can be increased by
        following these steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Navigate to the "<strong>Config</strong>" section of the
            <b>QS Administration interface</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            On the "<strong>Collector" </strong>tab consider increasing the following variables:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Collector</strong> <strong>Threads</strong> - Limits the total number of
                requests to external systems, each <strong>thread</strong> can be thought of as a
                single user, so 5 <strong>threads</strong> would roughly be the equivalent load of 5
                extra users
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Collector Domain Threads </strong> - Limits the total number of requests to
                each HTTP Domain (the root URL of a website or SharePoint environment etc).
                Depending on the content being crawled this will override the main "<strong
                  >Collector Threads" </strong
                >variable. I.E, if we are only crawling one website or one SharePoint environment
                and we have values of 10 and 5 for the main and domain variables respectively then
                the lower "<strong>Domains" </strong>value will used.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Collector File Threads</strong> - Limits the total number of requests made
                to file sources.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        We would recommend increasing these values slowly - reviewing the environment and then
        perhaps repeating. It is also important to continue monitoring the source system(s) as you
        increase the demands made on the environment.

        <strong>Indexer</strong>

        The <strong>Indexer </strong>service is largely bound by the
        <strong>IO/Disk/Memory</strong> performance available to the server. We would recommend
        considering the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The current <strong>IO </strong>usage level, in virtual environments this should be
            reviewed on the VM host
          </li>
          <li>
            The speed of the disks used for indexing (the <strong>CSE </strong>files location, by
            default: C:Program FilesConcept SearchingconceptDB). We recommend using solid-state
            storage, or the fastest disks available " high speed network appliances are also
            supported.
          </li>
          <li>
            When utilising a network storage device it is important to also monitor
            <strong>Network </strong>usage, and consider upgrading the Network link
          </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>Classifier</strong>

        The <strong>Classifier </strong>service is largely bound by the
        <strong>CPU </strong>performance available to the server. If these resources are not being
        fully utilised then you can increase throughput by following these steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Navigate to the "<strong>Config</strong>" section of the
            <b>QS Administration interface</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            On the "<strong>Classifier" </strong>tab consider increasing the "<strong
              >Classifier Threads</strong
            >", monitoring <strong>CPU </strong>usage as throughput increases
          </li>
        </ol>
        <b>Delays between batches</b>

        In smaller, less busy, environments you may sometimes see a "<strong>delay</strong>" between
        each batch. This can sometimes leave you waiting 30-45 seconds for a document to process
        through fully. This is nothing to worry about - the services are designed to go into a small
        "<strong>sleep</strong>" state when there is no more work to do in order to reduce demands
        on the SQL environment. You can optionally remove this "<strong>sleep</strong>" setting by
        following these steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Navigate to the "<strong>Config</strong>" section of the
            <b>QS Administration interface</b>
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduce the values of the following configuration options:
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Collector Polling</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Indexer Polling</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Classifier Polling</strong></li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
        Once updated please restart each of the affected services.
        <b>SQL Performance</b>

        If you are still seeing throughput issues, with little demand on the
        <strong>Netwrix Data Classification </strong>server then we would recommend reviewing the
        SQL Server host - in particular <strong>CPU </strong>and
        <strong>Memory </strong>utilisation.
