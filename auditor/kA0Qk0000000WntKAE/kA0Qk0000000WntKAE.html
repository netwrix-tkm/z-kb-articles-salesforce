        <div>
          <p>
            After migration to a new SQL Server instance or backup/restore of the SQL Server
            encryption key, the following error appears in the
            <b>SQL Server Reporting Services Manager</b>
          </p>

          <div>
            <pre class="has-inner-focus">
The feature: ‚ÄúScale-out deployment‚Äù is not supported in this edition of Reporting Services. (rsOperationNotSupported)</pre
            >
          </div>
        </div>

        <h2 id="cause">Cause</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            This error indicates that the restored key corresponds to the previous server, leading
            your Reporting Server instance to perceive itself as part of a multi-server deployment,
            which is not supported in the standard edition of Reporting Services.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            To resolve the issue, check the servers currently in use and remove the encryption key
            of the old server:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Open the <b>Report Server Configuration Manager</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Navigate to the <b>Scale-out deployment</b> tab.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Review your current configuration for any old servers.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Navigate to your Report Server database and check the [Keys] table. Delete the extra
                entries with the following statement:
              </p>
              <code>DELETE from dbo.Keys WHERE MachineName='X'</code>

              <p>where <code>'X'</code> is your old server name.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
