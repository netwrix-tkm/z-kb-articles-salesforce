        <div>
          <p>
            A monitoring plan in Netwrix Auditor is constantly in the <b>Working</b> status and the
            product fails to collect historical snapshots.
          </p>

          <p>The Netwrix Auditor System Health Log contains the following errors:</p>

          <pre
            class="has-inner-focus"
          ><code class="lang-Registry">Event ID 3127: Import of the latest snapshot failed. No items were imported.</code></pre>
        </div>

        <pre
          class="has-inner-focus"
        ><code class="lang-Registry">Event ID 3129: Execution Timeout Expired.  The timeout period elapsed prior to completion of the operation or the server is not responding. Operation cancelled by user.</code></pre>

        <h2 id="cause">Cause</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            These errors basically occur when the Auditor Audit databases misbehave with the current
            version of Microsoft SQL Server. However, there might be multiple root causes for the
            issue but below is the only one potential resolution.

        <h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>

        <div>
          <p>To resolve the issue, you need to install cumulative update for your SQL Server.</p>

          <p>
            Download and install

              <span><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> The State-in-Time snapshot for SharePoint Online
              occurs every 24 hours, usually at 03:00 or 04:00. So, once the above Cummulative
              Update is applied, you will need to wait until the following day to see the results.

          <p>
            To check the the issue has been resolved, run one of the SharePoint Online State-in-Time
            Reports. Make sure to provide it with a well-known object so that there is the greatest
            possibility of there being data returned, such as the
            <b>SharePoint Online Site Collections Access by User</b> Report.
