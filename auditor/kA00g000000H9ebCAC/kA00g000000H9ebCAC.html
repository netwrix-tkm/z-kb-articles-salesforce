        <h4 id="installation">Installing Netwrix Auditor on the New Server</h4>
        <div>
          When moving Netwrix Auditor to a new server, ensure the version and build of the Netwrix
          Auditor instance on your new server matches the old server version and build. Your new
          server should meet the
          <a

            >Software Requirements · v10.7</a
          >
          and
          <a
            href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/Auditor_10.7/page/Content/Auditor/Requirements/Console.htm"
            target="_blank"
            >Hardware Requirements · v10.7</a
          >.
        </div>
        <p> </p>
        <h4 id="eximport">Exporting the Netwrix Auditor configuration file</h4>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Stop and disable all Netwrix Auditor services except for
            <strong>Netwrix Auditor Configuration Server Service</strong> and
            <strong>Netwrix Auditor Core Service</strong> running in your original Netwrix Auditor
            server. This prevents Netwrix Auditor from running collections during the migration
            process.
          </li>
          <li>
            Disable any scheduled tasks for your Netwrix Auditor instance. These will be present in
            case any monitoring plan for Password Expiration Notifier, Inactive User Tracker, or
            Event Log Manager have ever been set up.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p> </p>
        <div>Now you can safely export the configuration by following the next steps:</div>
        <ol>
          <li>Run Command Prompt as administrator.</li>
          <li>
            Execute the following commands:
            <pre
              class="has-inner-focus"
            ><code class="lang-Registry">cd C:\Program Files (x86)\Netwrix Auditor\Audit Core
configserverDbProcessor.exe export -target "C:\naconfig.xml"</code></pre>
          </li>
          <li>Input an encryption password for the backup file.</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote class="Note">
            <strong>NOTE:</strong> You can use any target path to export the config file. Make sure
            to include the file name <strong>naconfig.xml</strong> to the end of the export path.
          </blockquote>
          <div>
            The configuration file has been successfully exported. Navigate to the target path to
            copy the config file to your new server. The file will be imported to the new Netwrix
            Auditor instance towards the end of the migration process.
          </div>
          <p> </p>
          <h4 id="ltamig">Long-Term Archive</h4>
          <div>
            By default, Long-Term Archive is located at C:\ProgramData\Netwrix Auditor\Data. If you
            have previously migrated your Long-Term Archive, you can find the location in your main
            Netwrix Auditor menu &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
            <strong>Long-Term Archive</strong>.
          </div>
          <div>
            Navigate to your Long-Term Archive location and copy the entire folder. Proceed by
            transferring Long-Term Archive to the new Netwrix Auditor server. While you can migrate
            it to the default location, it is recommended to keep Long-Term Archive on a separate
            drive. This will prevent rapid storage consumption on the C drive. Take note of where
            you have placed Long-Term Archive on the new Netwrix Auditor server.
          </div>
          <blockquote>
            <blockquote class="Note">
              <strong>NOTE:</strong> You can split the Long-Term Archive migration into two steps if
              the size of your ActivityRecords folder doesn't allow for a quick migration. For
              additional information, refer to the following article:

          <h4 id="sqlmig">SQL Databases</h4>
          <div>
            It is important to decide on migration of your SQL databases or keeping them in your
            current SQL Server instance during the Netwrix Auditor migration. In case you'd like to
            migrate your SQL Server databases, refer to the following article for additional
            information:

              Netwrix Auditor requires a reference to the new SQL Server instance. Refer to the
              following steps to find the instance name:
