          <p>What is SessionID in Netwrix Auditor for File Servers?</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            This attribute is based on the user’s logon ID within the current session. Being unique
            for a user’s logon session, it usually helps to distinguish the events and changes that
            occurred within that session.
          </p>

          <p>
            Session IDs are used to identify changes made by users with unique logon ID's. Session
            IDs are a combination of both the logon ID itself and the current session associated
            with this logon ID, to help identifying who made the change. Thus, session ID can be
            changed due to the fact that Netwrix would count that as a separate activity record
            too.<br /><img

              height="241"
              src="kA0Qk0000000LndKAE_f88c960d-c57a-4ae8-9929-55f2d12a690e.jpg"
              width="500"
            />
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition, Netwrix Auditor generates the following attribute besides Session ID,
            associated with the object and reserved for internal use:
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Statement ID</b> — This attribute appears if an object was moved/renamed due to its
            root object modifications.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since the product associates Session IDs with the current session of the user, this is
            expected behavior to see the different session ID for the same user after that user was
            logged out.
