        How does Password Expiration Notifier (PEN) work?
        <hr />
        Note: This only includes the main function algorithm; advanced features are not included.<br />1.
        LDAP query is used to determine the Maximum Password Age for the domain.<br />2. A list of
        users is also determined via LDAP query.<br />3. First user from the list is processed.<br />4.
        The "pwdLastSet" attribute value is determined for this user.<br />5. The number of days
        before the password expires in is determined based on the Maximum Password Age as well as
        the value of "pwdLastSet".<br />6. PEN checks whether the user matches the conditions
        specified in the settings (e.g. list of users whose password expires in xx days,
        notification options and advanced settings).<br />7. If the user matches the conditions then
        it is added to the report, if not, then the next user in the list is processed.
