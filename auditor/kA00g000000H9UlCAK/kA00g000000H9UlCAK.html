        I get a report showing a change with details: “User Account Locked Out” for the domain
        administrator account that cannot be locked out. What does this change mean?
        <hr />
        The domain administrator account cannot be locked out. Windows may generate "false" lockout
        events triggered by changes that could potentially cause this account lockout based on your
        account policies. The event is generated as a result of the actions that were performed on
        the domain administrator account, for example when someone entered the domain
        administrator’s password incorrectly several times in a row. Netwrix Auditor includes
        "false" lockout events in reports and alerts since they cannot be differentiated from "real"
        lockouts.
