        <h3 id="health_status_dashboard">Health Status Dashboard</h3>

        <p>
          As a Netwrix Administrator you need the tools and knowledge to maintain a healthy and
          efficient installation of Netwrix Auditor. Here are the tips and tricks for monitoring
          Netwrix Auditor health.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the home page we can click "Health Status". This presents administrators with a
          handful of extremely useful visuals.
        </p>

        <h4 id="activity_records_by_date">Activity Records by Date</h4>

        <p>
          This dashboard tile helps an administrator maintain visibility on data flow. The most
          obvious purpose this serves is confirmation of collection. You may also find that these
          statistics help you predict future need of resources. If incoming activity records
          increase, consideration of more storage or CPU cores may be required. You can use the
          matrix seen
          <a
            href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/Auditor_10.5/page/Content/Auditor/Requirements/HardwareRequirements.htm"
            target="_blank"
            >here</a
          > to see recommended hardware based on incoming Activity Records per day.
        </p>

        <h4 id="monitoring_overview">Monitoring Overview</h4>

        <p>
          The Monitoring Overview allows administrators to see all a complete picture of monitoring
          plan health. Plans with errors will show with a status of "Take Action", while healthy
          plans will show "Ready". The "Filter" option allows administrators to look at specific
          Data Sources or groups of Monitoring Plans to tailor visibility to specific needs.
        </p>

        <h4 id="health_log">Health Log</h4>

        <p>
          The information seen in the Netwrix Auditor Health Log is directly pulled from a Windows
          Event Log called "Netwrix Auditor System Health". Information seen here can vary vastly
          between environments. Messages can vary from informational, warning, and error based.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is also the chance that the Health Log is relaying an error received from an audited
          data source. If limited information is found in our documentation, you may find that the
          error is directly from the audited source. In this case, it is beneficial to google search
          the error as well. This often reveals that the error exists with the data source itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Health Log also provides the option for filtering, allowing administrators to view
          messages from specific data sources/monitoring plans, as well as different types of
          messages (Information, warning, errors).
        </p>

        <p>
          There may be times where Netwrix Auditor Technical Support requests a copy of your Health
          Log. To provide this file, please view the steps

            target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >. More details on the Health Log can be obtained
          <a
            href="https://helpcenter.netwrix.com/bundle/Auditor_10.5/page/Content/Auditor/Admin/SystemHealth/EventLog.htm"

            >here</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h4 id="database_statistics">Database Statistics</h4>

        <p>
          Similar to the Activity Records Statistics tile, this dashboard allows administrators to
          view the status of SQL Audit Databases, size of Audit Databases, and amount of Activity
          Records stored.
        </p>

        <p>Double-clicking a database name will expand the block and reveal more information.</p>

        <p>
          This dashboard can assist with troubleshooting in instances where data may not be
          available for searching and reporting. Remember that SQL Express databases have a limit of
          10 GB for storage.
        </p>

        <h4 id="long_term_archive">Long Term Archive</h4>

        <p>
          This simple, yet effective, tile gives administrators insight on Long Term Archive storage
          usage. You may hear Technical Support refer to this as the "LTA". If you notice rapid
          growth and you have not placed the Long Term Archive on a drive independent of the System
          Drive, please follow the steps
          <a href="https://kb.netwrix.com/247" target="_blank">here</a> to migrate your Long Term
          Archive.
        </p>

        <h4 id="working_folder">Working Folder</h4>

        <p>
          The Working Folder is a structure of files that plays an integral part in event
          processing. Similar to the LTA tile, this tile will provide visibility on Working Folder
          growth. Expect this directory to grow and shrink periodically as it receives data,
          processes, and then sends it off for storage in SQL and the LTA. This directory can also
          be migrated to a drive independent to the system drive. The steps to migrate the Working
          Folder can be viewed
