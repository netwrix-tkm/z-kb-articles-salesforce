          <p>
            The <strong>Backups</strong> folder located in
            <code>C:\ProgramData\Netwrix Auditor\Backups</code> occupies some space after multiple
            upgrades done previously. Is it safe to delete it?
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="answer">Answer</h2>

          <p>
            It is strongly recommended to keep the backups for supported versions. Once a version is
            not supported, it is safe to delete the corresponding backups. As of August 2023, there
            are 3 supported versions (10, 10.5, and 10.6). Refer to the following link for
            additional information on supported versions of Netwrix Auditor:

              >Supported Versions â€” Netwrix Auditor</a
            >.

              <span><strong>NOTE: </strong></span>The <strong>Backups</strong> folder contains
              backups for prior versions of Netwrix Auditor in case some files are corrupted during
              an upgrade. It may contain backups for all versions previously used in your
              environment.
