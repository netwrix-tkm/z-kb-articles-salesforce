        The Non-owner Mailbox Access Reporter shows that users access their own mailboxes.
        <hr />
        There is a Mailbox Archive option in Microsoft Exchange that creates a linked mailbox with
        the same name as the user's own mailbox. The user is not an owner of that linked archive
        mailbox. Each time the user runs Outlook, it reads the archive mailbox content, basically
        performing non-owner access.
        <hr />
        In order to omit such events perform the following steps:
        <ol>
          <li>
            On the Exchange server, run the Exchange Management Shell and perform the following
            cmdlet 'Get-Mailbox | %{$mailboxstring = ""; $mailboxstring += "%domain
            name%";$mailboxstring += "";$mailboxstring += $_.samaccountname; $mailboxstring += "=";
            $mailboxstring += $_.emailaddresses[0].addressstring; echo $mailboxstring &gt;&gt;
            C:\usermailboxesomitlist.txt}' (without quotes and replace the %domain name% with
            netbios name of your domain name).
          </li>
          <li>
            Copy the usermailboxesomitlist.txt from the Exchange server to the Non-owner Mailbox
            Access Reporter installation folder, by default it is C:\Program Files (x86)\Netwrix
            Auditor\Non-owner Mailbox Access Reporter for Exchange
          </li>
        </ol>
        NOTE: If you create a new user with mailbox, you should add it to the existing
        usermailboxesomitlist.txt file located at the Non-owner Mailbox Access Reporter home folder
        using the following format: domainusername=mailbox (E.g.: CORPjsmith=jsmith@corp.com).
