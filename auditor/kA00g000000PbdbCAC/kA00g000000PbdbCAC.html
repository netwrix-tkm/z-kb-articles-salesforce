        Registry changes have been applied per
        <a href="https://kb.netwrix.com/600" target="_blank">KB600</a> but the memory usage is still
        very high.

        <hr />

        Account Lockout Examiner tracks events from the security log and then processes them to get
        information, such as account name, workstation name, ip address, etc. These types of issues
        are related to very high activity in the environment - number of events to track is more
        than the Account Lockout Examiner service can handle and a queue builds up in memory. In
        most cases such activity is related to having several accounts (one or two "problem"
        accounts) that generate too many invalid logons per second.

        <hr />

        First, try to perform additional tuning of the product via the registry. On the Account
        Lockout Examiner host machine:
        <ol>
          <li>Run Registry Editor (regedit)</li>
          <li>
            Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARE[Wow6432Node]NetWrixAccount Lockout Examiner
            (Wow6432Node only for x64 OS)
          </li>
          <li>Make sure "<span>LockoutStatusRefreshPeriod" is 0.</span></li>
          <li>
            Set "<span>InvLogonCleaningPeriod" </span><span>value</span
            ><span> to 10 or lower decimal</span>
          </li>
          <li><span>Set "invLogonKeepTime" value to 10 or lower decimal</span></li>
          <li>
            <span
              >*Create DWORD called "PF_Enabled" and set its value to 0 (do this if you are not
              interested in name of the process causing invalid logons)</span
            >
          </li>
          <li>Restart NetWrix Account Lockout Examiner service via Services.msc</li>
        </ol>
        <span />
