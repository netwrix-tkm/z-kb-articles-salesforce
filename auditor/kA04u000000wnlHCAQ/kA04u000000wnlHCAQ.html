                Why do Netwrix Auditor service accounts access the domain controllers in the
                monitored environment?
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Why do service accounts create so many logon and logoff events in Security event
                logs?
              </p>

            The service accounts specified and used in Netwrix Auditor monitoring plans access
            domain controllers in your environment to collect data. The data collection process is
            performed in short spans allowing a service account to connect to the domain controller,
            collect data, and disconnect from one. Multiple service accounts can connect to domain
            controller at a time to ensure the timely delivery of data, either via reports or search
            functionality. This also allows to timely collect data before it is overwritten in
            environments with a high number of Activity Records âˆ’ the high number of logon and
            logoff events is expected.
