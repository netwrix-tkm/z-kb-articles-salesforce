        What load does SQL audit generate for audited SQL servers?
        <hr />
        The most noticeable impact on your SQL servers would be during the initial data collection.
        Netwrix Auditor runs several SQL scripts to build and store a ‘baseline’ of data against
        which it will compare future collections. However, even this initial collection will result
        in very little performance impact unless you are already running your servers at capacity.
        During subsequent data collections the impact will be even lower.<br />With daily
        collections running at 03.00 AM by default and SIT collections running at 4:00 AM, there may
        be a conflict with maintenance tasks running at the same time. If you are planning to run
        heavy maintenance jobs on your SQL servers during off-hours, please consider doing that
        before 03:00 AM.
