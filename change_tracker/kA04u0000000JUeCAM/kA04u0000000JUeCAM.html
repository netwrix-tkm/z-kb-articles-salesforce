        <h2 id="">Sending Syslog Messages From A Web Page<br />Application Note</h2>

        <p>
          It is not difficult to interface a web page with JavaScript to send an arbitrary syslog
          message to Log Tracker Server when a page is accessed, or some other JavaScript event
          occurs (such as clicking a button, or even performing a mouse over.) There are several
          configuration steps required, as detailed in this application note.
        </p>

        <h2 id="">CorreLog Server Setup</h2>

        <p>
          At the Log Tracker Server, first create a CGI program that is executed whenever a
          particular URL is accessed. The syslog text can be passed via an HTTP "GET" request.
          Although there are various ways to do this, one way is to leverage the standard Log
          Tracker Server "system\sendlog.exe" program via a simple batch file.
        </p>

        <p>
          The following batch file, depicted EXACTLY BELOW, can be transcribed to the file<br />location
          "s-auth\SENDLOG.bat" on the Log Tracker Server platform.
        </p>

        <div>
          <div>
            <pre>
@echo off
echo Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
echo Content-type: text/html
echo.
set msg="%REMOTE_ADDR% %*"
..\system\sendlog.exe 127.0.0.1 %msg%</pre
            >
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          The above batch file simply provides the correct headers, and then executes the standard
          Log Tracker "sendlog.exe" program (found in the "system" folder of each Log Tracker
          installation), passing to the "sendlog.exe" program whatever message was passed as part of
          the URL. Standard Windows "batch" commands are used.
        </p>

        <p>
          The location of the batch file is important: The "s-auth" directory of Log Tracker is
          normally used ONLY for error handling, and does not require authentication to execute a
          CGI Log Tracker, Inc. Page 2 support program. At some sites, you may need (or desire) to
          put an htaccess.txt file in that directory if limiting access to the URL is a big concern.
        </p>

        <h2 id="">Client (Web Site) Setup</h2>

        <p>
          At the Client web site, the user should first implement JavaScript functions to needed to
          "get" the URL. Although this is not a particularly difficult activity, the documentation
          is hard to find on the web, so specific notes on how to accomplish this are provided
          below.
        </p>

        <p>
          You can create a small JavaScript library, called "sendlog.js", by transcribing the
          file<br />below to a path accessible to your URL path EXACTLY as shown below:
        </p>

        <div>
          <div>
            <pre>
// Filename: sendlog.js
var request = makeHttpObject();
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
function makeHttpObject()
{
try { req = new XMLHttpRequest(); }
catch(err1) {
try { req = new ActiveXObject("Msxml2.XMLHTTP"); }
catch(err2) {
try { req = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.XMLHTTP"); }
catch(err3) {
req = false;
}
}
}
return(req);
}
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
function SendLog(message)
{
// NOTE: Modify below to use your actual server name
this_url = "http://logtracker-server/s-auth/sendlog.bat?";
this_url = encodeURI(this_url + message);
request.open("GET", this_url, false);
request.send(null);
return;
}</pre
            >
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Note that the script MUST be configured with the hostname of the Log Tracker Server, hard
          coded above as "logtracker-server" in the "SendLog()" function. The user should replace
          "logtracker-server" in the above file with the actual name or IP address of the Log
          Tracker Server platform.
        </p>

        <p>
          The above JavaScript can be cut and paste to any URL available to the client web server.
          In the specific case of the Log Tracker Server, JavaScript files are normally placed in
          the "s-html\java" directory of the installation, but any pathname (including external
          URLs) can be used.
        </p>

        <p>
          At some sites, the above JavaScript file may be found in the "s-html\java\sendlog.js" file
          of the Log Tracker Server installation. This can be directly copied from there to the
          client web server, and then modified to supply the actual name of the Log Tracker Server
          platform in the script.
        </p>

        <h2 id="">Implementing the SendLog() JavaScript Call</h2>

        <p>
          As a last step, the web page should execute the "SendLog()" function contained in the
          "sendlog.js" file above. The SendLog() function is executed for any browser event, such as
          when the page loads.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, the following trivial web page will send the message: "The test page was
          loaded!" to the Log Tracker server whenever the page loads. The page below assumes that
          the "sendlog.js" script (discussed above) is found at the "/s-html/java/sendlog.js" URL,
          accessible to the web page.
        </p>

        <div>
          <div>
            <pre>

 </pre
            >
          </div>
        </div>
        This is a test page. A syslog message was sent.

        <p>
          With the JavaScript configured above, whenever someone accesses the page, then a message
          "The test page was loaded!" will appear in the Log Tracker Server "Messages" tab. This
          message can be processed like any other syslog message collected by Log Tracker Server.
          Multiple "SendLog()" JavaScript calls can be implemented in the web page, each with their
          specific message arguments.
        </p>

        <h2 id="">Additional Notes</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              The actual hostname of the Log Tracker Server is essential, and in the above example
              the value should be set in the "sendlog.js" script example shown above. (This may be a
              common mistake in setting up syslog for your web page!)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The SENDLOG.bat file will operate with the Apache configuration that comes with Log
              Tracker Server. If you are using some other server, it may be necessary to change the
              server configuration, or use a more proper scripting language.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            In the SENDLOG.bat file, it will be essential to include the
            "Access-Control-AllowOrigin:"<br />
            header. Otherwise, the JavaScript will fail with a "permission" error.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The severity of the syslog message will be the default "debug" severity, and the
              facility code will be the default "user" code. As configured, the syslog message will
              contain the remote address of the web site that accessed the URL (given by
              %REMOTE_ADDR% environmental variable). The "sendlog.exe" program execution statement,
              within SENDLOG.bat, can be modified to prefix the message, change the facility and
              severity, and perform other custom processing such as include additional CGI
              environmental variables.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
