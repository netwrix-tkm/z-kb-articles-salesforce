          Log Tracker Windows Agents a can easily forward messages to the UNIX "rsyslogd" processes
          (and other syslog receivers) running on UNIX or Linux platforms. This is accomplished
          rather simply, as described here:

                syslog message reception and logging to a file The following directives are used in
                the "rsyslog.conf" configuration file:</span

                >hese directives frequently exist in the file within the "GLOBAL DIRECTIVES"
                section, and the administrator can simply uncomment these directives to have the
                "rsyslogd" process listen for messages at UDP port 514. Or the UNIX administrator
                can simply add these directives in the "GLOBAL DIRECTIVES" section of the file.</em

                using the RULES section of the "rsyslog.conf" file. The following directives are
                sufficient to log all messages received by the "rsyslogd" process to the
                /var/log/all.log file:</span

                  >When finished with the above configuration, the UNIX administrator restarts the
                  "rsyslogd" process. (Note that it may or may not be sufficient to execute a "kill
                  -HUP" command; the administrator should actually restart the process for these
                  particular changes to take effect.) Once the"rsyslogd" process has resumed
                  execution, the process should create the /var/logs/all.log" file created in step 2
                  above.</span

                  >At a Windows platform that is running the Log Tracker Windows Agent program, the
                  MS Windows administrator can test the message reception of the "rsyslogd" process
                  using the "sendlog.exe" program. The "sendlog.exe" program is a standard command
                  line utility that comes with the Log Tracker Windows Tool Set (WTS) programs. The
                  "sendlog.exe" program can be used to send arbitrary test messages to the
                  "rsyslogd" process. These messages will then appear in the "/var/log/all.log" file
                  on the UNIX platform configured above.<br /><br /><em
                    >If no messages are received at the UNIX platform, check for the existence of
                    firewalls between the client and the "rsyslogd" process, and verify that the
                    "rsyslogd" process is listening on UDP port 514. Also check the "all.log" file
                    for any other messages that may indicate an incorrect configuration of the
                    "/etc/rsyslog.conf" file. Finally, note that AV software can block transmission
                    of messages.</em

              Finally, the MS Windows administrator configures the Log Tracker client software to
              send messages to the IP address where the "rsyslog" rocess is executing. This can be
              accomplished by specifying the "DestinationAddress" value (or "AuxAddress" value)
              within the Windows agent "CO-sysmsg.cnf" file, and then restarting the CO-sysmsg.exe
              program.
