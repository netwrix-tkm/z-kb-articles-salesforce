        <p>
          <br />Change Tracker Gen 7 has been designed to localize baseline data with the Agent. The
          key advantage of an Agent for FIM is that it can monitor file changes in real-time. Due to
          the agent being installed on the monitored host, the OS activity can be monitored and any
          file activity can be observed and changes recorded.<br /><span
            class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"
            ><img
              class="confluence-embedded-image"
              height="338"
              src="kA04u0000000JSHCA2_623f5f1f-f74c-49c4-b334-f7bda15ac80d.png"
              width="526" /></span
          ><br />The second major advantage of an agent is that the monitored host does not need to
          be 'opened up' to allow monitoring. All critical system and configuration files will
          always be protected by the host filesystem security, for example, the Windows System 32
          folder is always an 'Administrator Access Only' folder. An Agentless monitoring approach
          would therefore need to operate using an Admin-level account with network access to the
          monitored host, while an Agent can operate within the confines of the Host, just pushing
          out File Integrity changes as they are detected. Finally an Agent offers a further
          advantage over and above the Agentless approach in that it can offer a 'changes only'
          update across the network, and will only require host resources when there is a change to
          assess and report. By contrast, for every polled check, an Agentless scan will always need
          to re-examine and generate new hash values for all files in order to detect any changes
          even if there are none. See 'FIM Agent Versus Agentless FIM'
        </p>

        <p>
          <br />However, there are cases whereby the baseline data has other useful applications
          outside of change detection for the individual host, for example
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            To retain a 'hard copy' of a device's configuration settings, for example, a router
            config or firewall ruleset, or full software inventory
          </li>
          <li>
            To compare one host's build standard with another/many others. While the CIS Benchmark
            reports built into
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Change Tracker will assess a host's configuration settings, other configuration/build
          attributes beyond the scope of the CIS Benchmark may be pertinent, for example,
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>installed software and updates</li>
          <li>open ports</li>
          <li>folder/filesystem structure</li>
          <li>specified versions of files</li>
          <li>service and process lists</li>
          <li>
            other general configuration settings outside of the scope of the CIS Benchmark, e.g.
            Application specific settings
          </li>
          <li>
            To mine a configuration for specified items, for example, the hash value for a known-bad
            version of a file
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In all these examples, a full record of the configuration settings for a device is needed
          to be held at the Gen 7 hub for re-use, and for these instances, the 'Send Baseline
          Events' checkbox should be used in the Configuration Template.
        </p>

        </h2>

        <p>
          <br />Any tracker can be enabled for the collection of Baseline Events by checking the
          'Send Baseline Events' box.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p>
          See below for an example of the 'Send Baseline Events' checkbox – this will result in the
          Installed Software and Updates baseline being pushed back to the Hub as a series of
          Baseline Events.<br /><span
            class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"
            ><img

        <p>
          The baseline data is sent to the Hub as a series of Baseline Events. These can be viewed
          directly in the Events screen by selecting Baseline Events.<br
            class="atl-forced-newline"
          />
          <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"

              class="confluence-embedded-image"

        </p>

        <p>
          There are two types of Baseline Event – a Current Baseline and Historical Baseline. When a
          change is made to the Baseline data e.g. by adding, changing or removing a configuration
          element, the Current Baseline is updated to reflect the change and a new Historical
          Baseline event is also created as a record of the previous Baseline for the device.<br /><span

        </h2>

        <p>
          <br />For a text output-based Tracker, for example, Network Ports, the Baseline data is
          the full scan output.<br /><span
            class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"
            ><img

              width="458" /></span
          ><br />Or for a firewall/router, the Baseline Records allow you to capture a full config
          record as well as the interim changes made via the Device Events.<br /><span
