          Edit and upload/download configuration policy templates – the default templates provided
          with Change Tracker Gen 7 are already aligned to default Device Groups, but this
          association can be changed together with the make-up of the Configuration Monitoring
          policy

          Create/Edit a Configuration Monitoring Policy
        </h3>
        <p>
          To create a new Configuration Monitoring Template, either upload a pre-defined template
          file provided by NNT, or click ‘+ Add a Template’.
        </p>
        <p>To Edit a template, just click on the ‘Edit’ button alongside the template name.</p>
        <p>
          A Configuration Monitoring Policy template comprises a wide range of attributes that can
          be monitored including Files/Folders and File Contents, Registry Keys/Values, Installed
          Software and Updates, Processes and Services (Running and Startup states), Security and
          Audit Policy* and Local User Accounts* (<em>* Windows platforms only)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the key strengths of Change Tracker Gen 7 is that even the configuration of complex
          FIM policies is straightforward. Templates for all standard platforms are provided, based
          on trusted guidance from the Center for Internet Security.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a custom policy is needed, for example, to protect the integrity of a bespoke
          application, set-up is easy too. Paths and files to track are specified along with details
          of the file/folder-match specification to use – these can be pre-defined and just picked
          off from a drop-down menu so there is no need to always be working out commands to use and
          any regular expressions needed to target the tracking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly there is a simple way to define exclusions, again with or without using a
          file/folder-match specification. This same approach is extended to Registry tracking so
          that precisely the keys and values that need to be tracked are.
        </p>
        <p>
          This results in a precision, tailor-made monitoring policy to only track changes where
          required, eliminating spurious changes and unwanted ‘change noise’.
