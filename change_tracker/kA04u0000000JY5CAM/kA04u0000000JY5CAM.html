          A common requirement of Log Tracker users is to detect and report when devices go "red" on

            <p>
              A common requirement of Log Tracker users is to detect and report when devices go
              "red" on the Log Tracker Server "Devices" screen, indicating that a device is no
              longer sending messages.
            </p>

            <p>You can easily configure an alert to detect this condition as follows:</p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                Create a new correlation thread that detects the key phrase "message source is
                idle".
              </li>
              <li>
                Create an alert that opens a ticket if the above thread increments by one count in
                zero seconds. (This sets an alert for any and all occurrences of this message.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Optionally, create a daily e-mail report that lists the raw messages for the thread
                created in step 1 above. This report will be sent each day at midnight (only if at
                least one device has been reported offline during the previous day.)
              </li>
              <li>
                Optionally, drill down into the "Devices &gt; Advanced" screen, and set the "Message
                Idle Time" threshold to be 1-Day, or 1-Hour, or 4-Hours, or some other value.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              The above configuration relies on the internal message that is sent by Log Tracker
              when a device transitions from green to red. The specific text of this message (which
              is generated for each and every occurrence of this situation) is as follows:
            </p>

            <p>
              <em
                >Log Tracker Network Monitor: Message source is idle. No messages received from
                '(device)' address during last (threshold). Message source is no longer sending
                periodic messages, and may be offline.</em
              >
            </p>

            <p> </p>

            <p>
              The thread created in step 1 above captures these messages. The alert configured in
              step 2 will open a ticket when this condition exists (which can send e-mail by
              triggering a "Ticket Action".)
            </p>

            <p>
              See attached screenshot for additional notes on the "Message Idle Time" setting, found
              on the "Messages &gt; Catalogs &gt; Devices &gt; Advanced" screen.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, note that a good alternative to using the above thread and alert is to simply
              send e-mail when a Log Tracker advisory is generated. (The "Advisory" facility sets a
              system advisory when one or more devices are not sending messages, among many other
              advisories that can be generated.) The operator can configure e-mail for advisories
              using the "System &gt; Prefs &gt; Modify Advisories" screen -- scroll down to the
              bottom of the "Modify Advisories" screen (aka "Advisory Preferences Screen) to enable
              and configure the Advisory e-mail notifications.
