          Log Tracker Server uses a "self-signed" certificate to authenticate the Log Tracker
          Server, which may be suitable for a wide range of activities within your organization.
          However, without taking special action (as discussed here) your browser will display a
          warning message when the web server is accessed, which may be annoying or unacceptable for
          some organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          To definitively remove all certificate errors that appear in browsers, you should purchase
          a certificate from a "Certificate Authority" and install this certificate as discussed
          below.
        </p>
        <p>
          After installing the " Log Tracker Apache TLS" server on your platform and executing the
          setup procedure, perform the following actions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Contact a "Certificate Authority" (CA) such as Comodo or DigiCert and indicate you would
            like to purchase a web certificate for the Log Tracker Server platform. Note that this
            is always a fee based service, and Log Tracker cannot do this for you (for security
            reasons).
          </li>
          <li>
            Review the Certificate Authorities instructions to you (if any.) The Certificate
            Authority may ask for a CSR (Certificate Signing Request) file for the server. If they
            ask for this item, send this file to them:
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p />
        <div class="">C:\Program Files (x86)\NNT Log Tracker Suite\apache-tls\ssl\correlog.csr</div>
        <p>
          <em
            >Note: the above file is created by the Log Tracker Apache TLS setup wizard, and
            contains information regarding the name of the platform where Log Tracker Server is
            executing. The name of the platform, used in the URL, is critical, and cannot be changed
            without creating a new certificate for the platform.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>3.</em>The Certificate Authoritywill send you back a ".crt" file. (This file sometimes
          has a ".cer" suffix, but is the same file.) This is your web server security certificate,
          which must be installed at the Log Tracker Server site,<em
            >Note that this will normally occur ONLY after fees are paid, and after the Certificate
            Authority has verified your company identity.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >4. Copy the file received from the Certificate Authority to the following location:</em
          >
        </p>
        <div class="">C:\Program Files (x86)\NNT Log Tracker Suite\apache-tls\ssl\correlog.crt</div>
        <p class="">
          <em
            >Note: overwrite the file existing file with the purchased security certificate. It is
            advisable to backup both the old and new files, and keep these files in a secure and
            private location. These files should not be made publicly available, and should be
            considered confidential to your organization.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p class="">
          <em
            >5. Stop and restart the "Log Tracker Apache TLS" Service using the Windows "Services"
            dialog.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p class="">
          <em
            >6.Access the Log Tracker Server website with your browser, and verify that all warnings
            or errors are now gone.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p class="">
          If you still see a warning or error, then the most likely cause is that the host name in
          the certificate does not agree with the host name in the URL. Note that these two values
          must agree perfectly. For example, if the certificate contains the Fully Qualified Domain
          Name (FQDN), then that name must be used when accessing the Log Tracker Server, or an
          error will be displayed by the browser. The host name in the certificate is contained in
          the ".csr" file, generated by the Apache TLS Setup wizard. If you need to generate a new
          ".csr" file, run the C:\Program Files (x86)\NNT Log Tracker Suite
          \apache-tls\bin\MAKE_CERT.bat" file.
