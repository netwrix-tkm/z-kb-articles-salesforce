          assign a schedule if regular reports are required. <br />Saved Queries can be created via
          the Events page using the Filter controls to define the event types and scope<br />Previously
          generated Query Results can be reviewed below<br />Click on a Saved Query name to either
          define or edit a schedule for the query to be executed<br />Scheduled Saved Query results
          can be delivered by email â€“ by default, the Username used to create the Saved Query will
          receive the results to their assigned email address, however it is possible to extend the
          delivery of Saved Query email results to other email addresses by adding these into the
          Additional Email Address field. See the Users section earlier for more details on defining
          Usernames and email addresses.<br />If the 'Include Attachment?' Checkbox is left
          unchecked, the Saved Query results will be provided via a secure URL within the email
          body. This is useful to secure report results and also to cut down on potentially large
          attachments being emailed.
