          There are three main areas of difference between the professional solution and the
          community edition.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u><strong>1) The feed</strong></u
          ><br />The following list gives some examples of those professional enterprise-grade
          products which are only part of the professional Greenbone Security Feed:<br />-
          Generally, all Enterprise-grade products and all OT (i.e. ICS/SCADA) products<br />- MS
          Windows Server and back office solutions (e.g.: SharePoint, sql Server, others)<br />-
          Products from Palo Alto Networks, Cisco, Juniper Networks and Fortinet<br />- Oracle
          Solaris IBM WebSphere products (i.e. IBM WebSphere Application Server)<br />- Lotus Notes
          or SAP products<br />- VMWare paid products
        </p>
        <p>
          <u><strong>2) Solution delivery, deployment, and support</strong></u
          ><br />Probably nothing surprising here, the professional solution gets a full, SLA based
          support. The community edition not. There is more related to the appliances, which may not
          be relevant here.
        </p>
        <p>
          <u><strong>3) Features</strong></u
          ><br />The basic features are the same, still, some enterprise-oriented features are not
          part of the community edition. As examples:<br />- feed updates via S-Proxy<br />- system
          updates and upgrades included in the feed<br />- connectors to other Enterprise products
          like PaloAlto firewalls, SIEM systems, similar<br />- backup/restore, alarms/schedules<br />-
          Master/Slave architecture
