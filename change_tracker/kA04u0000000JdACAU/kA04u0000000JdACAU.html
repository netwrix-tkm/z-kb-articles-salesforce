            >Do you need to monitor devices in a DMZ/PCI zone which is isolated from the internet or
            has limited access to the network where your Log Tracker software is installed? Is there
            a single server within the PCI zone that has access to the internal/unsecure network,
            which can be used to feed all of the logs from your monitored devices to your Log
            Tracker server? If so, read on because this is the guide for you...</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to achieve what has been described above, you can utilise the "NNT Log Tracker
          Tunnel Sender Service".
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tunnel Sender is easy to get up and running. You setup a tunnel "Receiver" on the Log
          Tracker Server, and then setup a tunnel "Sender" on the secondary server you have
          configured (the secondary server will act as your feed to the internal/unsecure network).
          The tunnel "Sender" listens for messages on UDP port 514 and then sends these messages via
          TCP (with optional encryption) to the tunnel "Receiver" on the Log Tracker server. Log
          Tracker receives the TCP messages where they are then resent to Log Tracker using standard
          UDP.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Tunnel process uses TCP port 51462 by default but this port number can be easily
          modified.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ve listed below how it would be configured in a production environment and we’ve also
          provided a diagram to show how the monitored devices, tunnel sender, tunnel receiver and
          Log Tracker server will communicate together.
