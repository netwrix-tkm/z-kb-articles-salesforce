          Log Tracker allows you to login to the system using Active Directory authentication by
          configuring the "System &gt; Logins &gt; Security" screen. This lets you use your active
          directory password when logging into Log Tracker, and provides a few other benefits
          also.<br /><br />To use this function, the Log Tracker Server needs to be part of the
          Active Directory domain. (The Log Tracker Server authenticates the login user to the host
          platform, and if the platform is part of the domain, you can then use your Active
          Directory password, or a local password configured for the host platform.)<br /><br />Here
          is a configuration procedure.<br /><br />First, verify that Log Tracker Server is part of
          the domain. You can find out if this is true by successfully logging into the platform
          (not the web interface, but the actual platform running Log Tracker) with your active
          directory user name and password.<br /><br />After verifying the above, login to the Log
          Tracker Server web interface with an "admin" type login and execute the following steps.
        </p>

        <h2 id="">Step-by-step guide</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Navigate to the "System &gt; Logins &gt; Users" screen, and add an "admin" type user to
            the system.<br />
            <br />
            <em
              >The user name should be your precise "Active Directory" logon name without any slash
              or @ characters. For example, if your fully qualified logon domain, which you used to
              access the host platform, is "LOGTRACKER\Joe.Smith", then you will enter "joe.smith"
              as the user name. Note that you can enter a local password, but that password will
              generally be ignored. (It can be used as a backup password to permit you access should
              Active Directory not be available during the logon process.)</em
            ><br />
             
          </li>
          <li>
            Navigate to the "System &gt; Logins &gt; Security" screen, and click edit. On the
            "Security" edit screen, set the following parameters: (1) Set "Security Enhanced
            Functions" to be "Enabled"; (2) Set "Login Authentication Method" to be "Web Screen";
            (3) Set "Authenticate Using AD / SSPI" to be "True"; (4) Set "NetBIOS Logon Domain" to
            be the name of the NetBIOS domain. When finished, click "Commit".<br />
            <br />
            <em
              >Similar to the above: Note that the "NetBIOS Logon Domain is the domain used to
              access the platform without any slash or @ characters. For example, if your fully
              qualified logon domain, which you use to access the host platform, is
              "LOGTRACKER\Joe.Smith", then the "NetBIOS Logon Domain" is "LOGTRACKER".</em
            ><br />
             
          </li>
          <li>
            When you save the security settings, the system will generally log you out when you
            change these settings, returning you to the login screen. (This depends on your current
            user name.) If you are not automatically logged out, click the "Logout" link in the
            upper right of the display.<br />
             
          </li>
          <li>
            After logout, you will be presented with a login screen. Enter the username configured
            in step 1 above, and your active directory password. Note that, on the login screen, a
            drop-down menu appears that will let you login to the system using your Active Directory
            login name and password, or the password configured for you on the local platform (if
            any), or using the internal password configured in step 1 above.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p> </p>

        <p>
          You can now add additional users by following step 1 above. Note that, to have access to
          the Log Tracker Server, the active directory user name MUST be configured in the "System
          &gt; Logins &gt; Users", and the permission to the Log Tracker server must be set on that
          screen.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, an average Active Directory user can be assigned "admin" rights at the Log
          Tracker Server (or an Active Directory administrator may only have "guest" access to the
          Log Tracker Server.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Generally, the above steps are all that is necessary to configure the active directory
          interface. Various other options also exist, such as the ability to authenticate a user
          based upon an Active Directory group name, and the ability to disable any local logins
          using a password configured within Log Tracker.
