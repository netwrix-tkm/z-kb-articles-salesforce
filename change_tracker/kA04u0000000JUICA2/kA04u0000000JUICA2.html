        <p>
          Netwrix Change Tracker supports an Agentless approach to monitoring, which is useful for
          endpoints such as firewalls, routers, switches, appliances, or legacy Unix hosts. This
          approach is also ideal for quick, software-free implementations for monitoring
          Windows/Linux systems. Agentless File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) is performed using a
          dedicated Proxy Agent or the Proxy Agent function of the Netwrix Change Tracker Agent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Agentless scanning options include SSH, Telnet with full shell/command operation, CLI
          interaction, and Windows SMB/Named Pipe. Scans can be operated using the NNT-FileHash
          binary, a dissolvable/transient program that simplifies system integrity monitoring where
          file hash-based tracking is required. The Proxy Agent concept provides advantages in that
          setup and control of Agentless monitoring is consistent with Agent-based monitoring.

        <h2 id="instructions">Instructions</h2>
        <p>Follow these steps to configure a device for Agentless monitoring:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Register the Proxy Agent to the Change Tracker Hub.</li>
          <li>Select the Proxy Agent to use for Agentless monitoring.</li>
          <li>Enter the details of the new endpoint device for Agentless monitoring:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Name/IP Address</li>
            <li>(Optional) Device Type</li>
            <li>(Optional) Display IP/Name</li>
            <li>
              Credentials used for connection (select from the dropdown list of stored credentials)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            (Optional) If hash-based FIM is required, locate the relevant NNT_FILEHASH binary onto
            the host and add the path for the binary to the login script. This generates a
            cryptographic hash value for a file, providing a unique "DNA fingerprint" for the file
            that changes substantially even for minor modifications.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          Conceptually, all endpoint devices that need to be monitored using an Agentless approach
          must be associated with a Proxy Agent. This allows appropriate relationships to be
          established between the most local or best-resourced Proxy Agent and the endpoints to be
          monitored. For example, all devices at Customer Site A would naturally be associated with
          a Proxy Agent deployed to this site.
