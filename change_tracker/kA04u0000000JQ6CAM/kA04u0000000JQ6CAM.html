        <p>
          NNT Change Tracker Gen 7 represents a quantum leap in file integrity monitoring
          technology, intelligently analyzing events to highlight genuine security incidents.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          NNT Change Tracker has been awarded Certified Vendor status by the Center for Internet
          Security, providing confidence that CIS Benchmark hardening guidelines are always
          accurately applied to eliminate known vulnerabilities from all common platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          But detection of host intrusion and breach activity to combat the threats of spear
          phishing, contemporary malware and APT-style attacks also requires a forensic visibility
          of system integrity changes. Providing this level of detection-sensitivity also inevitably
          amplifies the regular background noise generated from system patching and routine
          application operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          Until now, getting the best from file integrity monitoring has resulted in products like
          Tripwire Enterprise – needing complicated rules to be configured to minimize change noise
          and constant manual-review of events before accepted changes are 'promoted to the
          baseline'.<br />
          Not any more. Change Tracker Gen 7 re-invents file integrity monitoring making it easy to
          use and even more effective for breach detection. The key difference is Closed-Loop
          Intelligent Change Control (CLICC).
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          CLICC reconciles the security benefits of forensic change control with the detailed
          workload necessary to review changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          The solution is 'Closed-Loop' and 'Intelligent', because any changes made are
          automatically assessed against expected or permitted changes to the configuration
          baseline, delivering all the benefits of zero tolerance to unplanned changes and a
          super-sensitive breach detection capability, but without the time-consuming,
          resource-intensive (and boring) post-implementation review burden. Planned change
          blueprints can be recorded from observed system behavior, continually enhancing system
          intelligence through recognition of regular behavior such as patching changes.<br />
          By automatically assessing changes, all expected/pre-approved changes such as known
          patching updates can be isolated leaving just unplanned changes – potentially breach
          activity - exposed, to then be properly investigated.
