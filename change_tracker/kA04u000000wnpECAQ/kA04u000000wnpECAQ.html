            HTTPS should already be configured for your Change Tracker server, this can be confirmed
            by the following steps below:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>RDP into the Change Tracker Server.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Open <b>Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Locate <b>Server Name</b> and expand the <b>Sites</b> dropdown.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Click <b>Change Tracker Generation 7n</b>. On this page, click <em>Bindings</em> and
                you should be able to see the HTTPS binding.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            This is also the location where a new certificate can be selected. It's worth noting
            that the Certificate needs to be signed by a CA which is trusted by all of the agents
            connecting to Change Tracker. If the agents do not have the CA trusted in it's store,
            adding the certificate's Thumbprint to the agent config would be required and the agents
            would all be disconnected until the thumbprint is added.
