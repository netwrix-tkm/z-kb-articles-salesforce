        <p>
          However, Change Tracker Gen 7 can operate in a proactive mode, learning to recognize
          change behaviors associated with approved Planned Change operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, were our ‚ÄòFIM_Test‚Äô change an approved patching operation that was going
          to be applied to all other hosts in the estate, instead of just reviewing and
          acknowledging the change when observed, we could instead create an Intelligent Planned
          Change based on the event.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that any other matching changes reported would also be automatically
          acknowledged, provided the changes were reported for approved devices, and were within the
          planned change time window.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this way, ‚Äòknown-good‚Äô changes can automatically be categorized as Planned Changes,
          and conversely, any other changes not matching a Planned Change rule would be flagged as
          Unplanned Changes. Since the overwhelming majority of changes should be Planned, this
          greatly enhances the clarity of the breach detection capability of Change Tracker by
          reducing the ‚Äònoise‚Äô generated by regular, pre-approved changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating an Intelligent Planned Change is a straightforward ‚Äòpoint and click‚Äô
          operation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Select the event or events to include in the Planned Change definition ‚Äì a separate rule
          will be created for each event.
        </p>
        <p>
          As previously, use the Actions button but this time, select the ‚ÄòCreate a new Planned
          Change to capture these events‚Äô function.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"
            ><img
              class="confluence-embedded-image"
              height="150"
              src="kA04u0000000JUDCA2_9c90cc9f-4a12-48c2-8b9a-f39808b78342.png"
          /></span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The default Planned Change format is to include the ‚Äòevent donor‚Äô Device Group only,
          but other or different groups can be selected. Similarly, the Planned Change window start
          time is taken from the donor event time and left as an ‚Äòongoing‚Äô open ended window but
          these can also be edited.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"
            ><img
              class="confluence-embedded-image"
              height="250"
              src="kA04u0000000JUDCA2_5dcb87c9-8c43-4896-a465-a918ad99a121.png"
          /></span>
        </p>
        <p>In this example just click Apply.</p>
        <p>Now delete the FIM_Test file created previously, then recreate the same file again.</p>
        <p>
          Finally, create a further new file in /etc called ‚ÄòUnapproved_FIM_Test‚Äô then refresh
          the Events page.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"
            ><img
              class="confluence-embedded-image"
              height="250"
              src="kA04u0000000JUDCA2_09c6ace9-0ce8-40d7-8ff6-e0894f3895eb.png"
          /></span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now events are being analyzed automatically, with the Intelligent Planned Change rules
          being applied to each one as it is recorded.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the default ruleset created, ‚ÄòFIM_Test‚Äô file operations are now approved
          so deletions, additions and even changes will all be automatically acknowledged as a
          ‚Äòknown-good‚Äô change.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, other file change operations not matching the rule will still be flagged as
          Unplanned changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The default Planned Change rule created can be seen in more detail by clicking on the
          <u>Planned </u>link, then clicking on the ‚ÄòShow Rules‚Äô button. Planned Change rules
          can be edited and managed via the ‚Äò<a href="https://kb.netwrix.com/8091" target="_blank"
            >Settings -&gt; Planned Changes Administration</a
          >‚Äô page.
