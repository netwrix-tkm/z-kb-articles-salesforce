        <p>
          It may be the case that some tickets, when opened, can be immediately closed on the
          system. This may be useful for example if the ticket runs some e-mail (or other action)
          and can then be immediately dismissed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The standard Log Tracker Server includes the "system\CloseTicket.exe" program as a regular
          command line utility, which can be used in a "Correlation &gt; Action" script so that when
          a ticket is opened that contains specific text, the ticket can immediately be closed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The "CloseTicket.exe" program can be executed at a command prompt (with no arguments) to
          see the syntax as follows:
        </p>
        <div class="">
          <span class=""> </span>
          <div class="">
            <p>Usage: CloseTicket -uid "(ticketuid)" [ "(resolution)" ]</p>
            <p>Also: CloseTicket -user "(assignee)" [ "(resolution)" ]</p>
            <p>Also: CloseTicket -match "(matchpatt)" [ "(resolution)" ]</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          As shown above, the CloseTicket.exe program can close tickets by a specific ticket UID, or
          all tickets for a specified user, or for all tickets that match a specified pattern or
          keyword.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the purposes of the procedure below, the "-match" option will be used and will be
          configured to close a ticket based on a keyword within the ticket text defined by the user
          on the "Alarms" screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          To configure this at the Log Tracker Server, perform the following steps: (1) The user
          creates a simple batch file wrapper in the "actions" folder of the server; (2) The user
          creates a "Correlation &gt; Action" entry via the "Correlation &gt; Actions &gt; Wizard"
          screen which immediately closes the ticket when a message occurs indicating the ticket has
          been opened.
        </p>
        <h2 id="">Step-by-step guide</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p class="">
              First, gain access to the Log Tracker Server "actions" folder and create a simple
              batch file called "CLOSE_TICKET.bat'. This batch file can consist of a single line as
              follows:
            </p>
            <div class="">
              <span class=""> </span>
              <div class="">
                <p>..\system\CloseTicket.exe %1 %2 %3</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </li>
          <li>
            Next, identify some text, keyword, or phrase associated with the ticket you want to
            close. Note that the text is defined by the user on the "Alerts" screen, and there
            should be some keyword or phrase associated with tickets (or tickets) you want to
            close.<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            When you are ready to configure the action, go to the "Correlation &gt; Actions" tab and
            click the "Wizard" button to add a new action.<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            On the first screen of the wizard, select "User Defined" as the "Action Type" (from the
            drop-down selection) and click the "Next" button.<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            On the second screen of the wizard, enter the text you identified in step 2 above. Then
            click the "Next" button.<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            On the third screen of the wizard, use all defaults EXCEPT can specify the "Match IP
            Address / Group" to be 127.0.0.1. (Note -- this is not absolutely required, but is good
            for safety and efficiency, since a syslog message is always sent to "127.0.0.1" when a
            ticket is opened.) When finished, click the "Next" button.<br /><br />
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="">
              On the fourth screen of the wizard, enter: "CLOSE_TICKET.bat" as the "Action Program
              Name". (Note - This is the batch file configured in step 1 above.) For the "Action
              Arguments", enter three arguments as follows:
            </p>
            <div class="">
              <span class=""> </span>
              <div class="">
                <p>-match "(keyword)" "Ticket auto-closed"</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p class="">
              Note that the first argument is "-match"; the second (keyword) argument is the keyword
              selected in step 2, and used in step 5; the third argument is the optional ticket
              resolution that will appear when the ticket is closed, which in the above case is
              "Ticket auto-closed", but can be something more specific at your site. When finished,
              click the "Finish" button to save the action program.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          8. When finished with the wizard, the action will appear on the top-level "Correlation
          &gt; Actions" screen. Test the system by generating some test messages, via the "Messages
          &gt; Search &gt; Post New Message" link, necessary to open a ticket. Note that the
          CLOSE_TICKET.bat file produces debug output, and the ticket will appear in the "Tickets
          &gt; Closed" tab as soon as it is opened (after triggering any action programs, such as
          sending e-mail.) The resolution for these closed tickets will be "Ticket auto-closed" (as
          configured above.)
        </p>
        <p>
          A simple example of the correlation action screen, after performing the above steps, is
          shown in the screenshot below:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class=""><img class="" width="" src="" /> </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em
            >Note that a common error is to select a keyword associated with the ticket that is a
            message keyword. This is not correct. For best results, simply define a tag that gets
            included in the ticket text content of all alarms that are to be auto-closed, such as
            "TICKET AUTO CLOSE". Or, create a ticket group called "auto-close" and assign all
            tickets that are to auto-closed to that ticket group.</em
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The "Correlation &gt; Action" facility passes a number of environmental variables to the
          batch file, which permits easy extension of the facility. These environmental variables
          documented in the User Manual and examples can be found in the "actions\TEMPLATE.bat" file
          that comes with the system. Additional information on applications such as this
          correlation action can be found in a variety of locations, including the Command Line
          Interface User Manual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, note that when a ticket is opened or closed, this can execute a "Ticket Action",
          which is a facility similar to the "Correlation Action" described here. Note that these
          two facilities operate in a similar fashion, but are actually completely separate.
          (Correlation Actions are executed on incoming messages, whereas Ticket Actions are
          executed when tickets are opened and / or closed.)
