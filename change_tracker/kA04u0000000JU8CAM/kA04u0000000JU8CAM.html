          FIM provides the forensic detail visibility and sensitivity to detect even the stealthiest
          breach but this may mean that previously unseen system activity now also becomes
          highlighted.
        </p>
        <p>
          To Manage Regular Activity such as Patching, System Upgrades and normal application
          operations will all be detected and reported but the beauty of Change Tracker Gen 7 is the
          range of options and power provided to automatically handle these.
        </p>
        <p>
          In summary, Change Tracker Gen 7 re-invents file integrity monitoring making it easy to
          use and even more effective for breach detection. The key difference is Change Tracker’s
          Closed-Loop Intelligent Change Control (CLICC).
        </p>
        <p>
          CLICC reconciles the security benefits of forensic change control with the detailed
          change-review required.
        </p>
        <p>
          The solution is ‘Closed-Loop’ and ‘Intelligent’, because any changes made are
          automatically assessed against expected or permitted changes to the configuration
          baseline, delivering all the benefits of zero tolerance to unplanned changes and a
          super-sensitive breach detection capability, but without the time-consuming,
          resource-intensive (and boring) post-implementation review burden. Planned change
          blueprints can be recorded from observed system behavior, continually enhancing system
          intelligence through recognition of regular behavior such as patching changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          By automatically assessing changes, all expected/pre-approved changes such as known
          patching updates can be isolated leaving just unplanned changes – which may be breach
          activity - exposed, to then be properly investigated.
        </p>

          Acknowledging Events
        </h2>
        <p>
          Any unexpected FIM event is potentially a security incident and needs to be investigated.
          Change Tracker makes this easy – FIM changes are summarized in simple terms, for example,
          for File system Events, the Event Description is prefixed with either ‘New File’, ‘Changed
          File’ or ‘Deleted File’.
        </p>
        <p>
          For more details, just click on the Event Description for any Device Event to see the full
          detail of the change.
        </p>
        <p>

          /></span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the Event has been reviewed and approved as valid and desirable, the Event can be
          acknowledged and assigned to a Planned Change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Select the Event(s) to acknowledge then use the ‘Actions’ button to access the options
          available.
        </p>

          /></span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Default option is to use the ‘Acknowledge Events under Planned Change’ and assign the
          event(s) to the ‘Manually Acknowledged Changes’ Planned Change.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Event will now be categorized as a ‘Planned Change’ and therefore will be masked by
          the filter control for ‘Unplanned’ Planned Change Status – edit the Filter to show Planned
          Changes only and the Event will be visible again.
