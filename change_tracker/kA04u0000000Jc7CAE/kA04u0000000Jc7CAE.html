          You can move your Log Tracker Server installation to a new platform simply, without losing
          any log data or configuration data.
        </p>
        <p>
          The entire Log Tracker Server software is contained in the root Log Tracker folder (by
          default C:\Program Files (x86)\NNT Log Tracker Suite, but often some other location.) This
          makes it easy to copy all files associated with the server to a new location, either a new
          disk or a completely new computer system.
        </p>
        <h2 id="">Step-by-step guide</h2>
        <p>
          To relocate the Log Tracker server to a new platform, perform the following simple steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Stop the "CorreLog Framework Service" with the Windows Service Manager, and verify with
            the task manager that all "CO" processes are stopped.
          </li>
          <li>
            Copy ALL the files in Log Tracker root folder over to a new location, such as with a
            file system share. Note that this can be a large amount of data that may take several
            minutes or even hours to complete.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the log files and archive files reside in a location that is different from the
            default location (as configured on the "Messages &gt; Config &gt; Parms" screen) copy
            these files to the new platform also, to a folder that is the same as on the old folder
            (such as D:\Logs and D:\Archives). This is only necessary if you have configured a
            non-default location for these files, on the "Messages &gt; Config &gt; Parms" screen.
          </li>
          <li>
            After all files are copied, on the new Log Tracker Server platform,run the "C:\Program
            Files (x86)\NNT Log Tracker Suite\system\CO-install.exe" program as administrator. This
            re-installs and configures program services at the new location, and restarts the
            ‚ÄúCorreLog Framework service‚Äù.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the Apache-TLS server is installed, also run the "C:\Program Files (x86)\NNT Log
            Tracker Suite\apache-tls\bin\CO-Secure.exe" program. This step e-configures the
            Apache-TLS process to use the new location as its document root directory. (This step
            also creates a new self-signed certificate for the Apache TLS server.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Rename or delete the old installation after successfully moving the directory, to avoid
            future confusion.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          It is possible (but not likely) that you have some paths in custom alerts, custom actions,
          or the local windows agent that need to be adjusted. This is not common, but should be
          mentioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          BE AWARE that the IP address of the Log Tracker server is configured as the message
          destination on all your managed network devices, hence it may require substantial
          reconfiguration of your network devices if you want to change the IP Address of the Log
          Tracker Server. For best results, just assign the old IP address of the Log Tracker Server
          to the new platform, and decomission the old platform completely.
