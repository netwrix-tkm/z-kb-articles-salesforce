            >If a new NNT Change Tracker Agent update is provided, this can be pushed out
            automatically from the Change Tracker server.The Agent update comprises a new set of
            program files, plus an 'upd' file which signs the update and confirms its integrity. You
            can download both files from our members area on the website which can be found in the
            following path:</span

        </p>

        <h2 id="">Step-by-step guide</h2>

        <p>Once both of those files above are downloaded, you are ready to start upgrading!</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            On the Change Tracker Server, head to the hub through a browser and navigate into
            the <strong>Agent Updates </strong>page which can be found in the following
            path: <strong>Settings </strong>→<strong> Agent Updates</strong>. From here, you can
            upload the two files you have downloaded as a zip by pressing on the <strong
              >Upload an update...</strong
            >
            button and highlighting both of the files downloaded and then click open. Once that is
            done, press on the <strong>Upload files </strong>button. The files will appear in the
            list. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Head into the <strong>Groups</strong> page which can be found in the following path:
            <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Groups</strong>. Create a new group by pressing
            the<strong>+ Add</strong>button and name the group as you wish. For this example, I have
            named the group "NNT Agent Update".
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you have created a new group, navigate into it and within there, head into the
            <strong>Agent Software Updates</strong>tab. Next, press the <strong
              >+ Define the update schedule</strong
            >
            button and choose the agent version, schedule the time the agent upgrade will take place
            and then press update.
          </li>
          <li>
            The final step is to head into the<strong>Agents &amp; Devices</strong>page which can be
            found in the following path:<strong
              >Settings &gt;<strong>Agents &amp; Devices.</strong></strong
            >Locate the device which has the agent on it that you would like to upgrade, press the
            edit button once the devices is located, add the new group you have created into the
            "Groups" field (in my case it will be NNT Agent Update) and then press the update
            button. You can see below that I searched for the device I wanted to push an agent
            update to and then added it to the group "NNT Agent Update" which can be seen in the
            groups column. 
          </li>
        </ol>
        Once the steps above are completed, the agent software update should take place
        automatically.
