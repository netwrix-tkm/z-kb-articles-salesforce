          NNT Change Tracker is a file integrity monitoring product, used for compliance programs,
          host intrusion detection and change control for enterprise IT systems. It is used by
          Enterprise IT organizations including the military, federal, banks, financial services,
          airlines, retailers, utilities and not-for-profit organizations around the world.

          <br />
          The product automates the collection of configuration data from any IT devices, including
          Servers and Desktops, database systems, firewalls, network routers and switches and stores
          a baseline for each device. Platforms supported include Windows, Linux, Unix, Oracle, SQL
          Server. <br />
          Configuration data collected is then analyzed for compliance with an organizations
          hardened build standard. This is typically based on a CIS Benchmark hardening checklist or
          one provided by a manufacturer such as Microsoft, Red Hat, Oracle or Cisco, for example.
          Compliance standards supported by Change Tracker include PCI DSS, DISA STIG, NERC CIP, ISO
          27001, GLBA), FISMA), HIPAA HITECH, S-OX, NIST 800-53 and GPG 13.

          Devices are then monitored continuously using either a Change Tracker Agent installed
          directly onto the device, or using a periodically scheduled agentless interaction with the
          device. Any changes recorded deviating from the initial baseline are assessed for a match
          with Planned Changes configured in the Change Tracker system. Planned Change rules can be
          recorded directly from a device exhibiting changes, for example, when pre-staging patches,
          or from observed changes reported by Change Tracker. The make-up of a Planned Change
          comprises the range of devices to assess, time window and details of the changes to match,
          such as a file change or registry value, for example. Due to the nature/variety of
          patches, hundreds of Planned Change rules can be active at any one time.
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />
          This feature has been referred to as Closed-Loop, Intelligent Change Control through its
          close alignment to COBIT or ITIL Change Control processes whereby changes are pre-approved
          via a 'Request For Change' process, then reviewed for accuracy and quality via a QA
          Testing or Post-implementation review. Change Tracker automates this entire process by
          reviewing changes observed against pre-defined Planned Change rules, or by retrospectively
          building new Planned Change Rules based on observed changes, hence the Closed-Loop
          terminology.<br />
          Any changes recorded that are not matched by a Planned Change rule are reported as being
          potentially breach activity. In this way, Change Tracker provides a Host Intrusion
          Detection System capability.
