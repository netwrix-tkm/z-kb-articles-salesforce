          Where it is desirable to not use an NNT Agent, or where the platform to be monitored does
          not currently have an NNT Agent available for it e.g. HP Non-Stop, NNT provide various
          Agentless FIM options. <br />
          All Agentless monitoring is performed via a Master Proxy Agent – the Proxy function is
          supported by any NNT Gen 7 Agent and the dedicated NNT Agent App Proxy Agent. <br />

          The architecture of the solution is based around Proxy Agent instances as in the diagram
          above. The solution components are as follows:<br />
          <strong><em>Proxy Agent:</em></strong> By default, every Gen 7 Hub server installation
          includes an NNT Proxy Agent App or in later deployments, an NNT Gen 7 Agent.<br />
          Additional Proxy Agent elements can be deployed to other devices to provide a distributed
          monitoring capability, useful in both reducing monitoring-traffic network loads and
          simplifying firewall rules where the devices being monitored are remote to the NNT Gen 7
          Hub. Any single Proxy Agent instance can monitor hundreds of devices.<br />
          <strong><em>Proxied Device:</em></strong> Once a Proxy Agent element has been established,
          the devices to be monitored can be configured. <br class="atl-forced-newline" />

          Adding a new Proxied Device requires the details opposite to be provided. Once the
          Names/Alias, IP Address/DNS Name of the device have been provided, the key element is the
          Credentials to be used. This defines aspects such as the protocol/terminal type to be
          used, username/password, and any login script/shell navigation.<br />
          <strong><em>Credentials:</em></strong> Note: For most scenarios, use the built-in
          Credentials Scripts accessible via the drop-down menu at the top of the 'Add Shell
          Credential'<br />

          The fields highlighted must always be filled – hit 'Update' in the bottom right-hand
          corner of the window when finished. In the Advanced Options there will be a definition of
          the path and name of the NNT File Hash binary being used. For high-security situations
          where it is desirable to maintain a 100% guarantee of a file's integrity, the Change
          Tracker NNT File hash binary is used. This is an extra command for the system that
          generates a hash value for all files serving as an infallible verification of file makeup.
          In addition, all file attributes will be tracked too.<br />
          <strong><em>NNT Filehash:</em></strong> You can select the required NNT Filehash binary
          for the platform to be monitored from Settings -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Advanced
          Options. The file should be placed on the host with appropriate execute permissions.<br />

          ><br />
          <strong><em>Completion:</em></strong> At this stage, the Proxied Device has been added to
          your Gen 7 system with the correct Credentials and a Logon Script assigned to it. The NNT
          Filehash has been copied to the host to be monitored and has been tested working.<br />
          At this point you can then treat the Proxied Device in exactly the same way as an
          Agent-Based Device. <br />
          Assigning the Proxied Device to a Group will apply a Configuration Template to the device
          together with any Compliance Reports for the Group, and any events and alerts will be
          displayed and handled in the same way as for any Agent-Based Device.<br />

        </h4>
        <p>
          You can verify if the NNT Filehash is operational by logging onto the system to be
          monitored and entering the command NNT_Filehash_xxxx (where xxxx is the suffix for your
          chosen NNT Filehash binary e.g. NNT_FILEHASH_LINUX_x64. Here the NNT_Filehash has been
          correctly copied to a valid executable path for the host, and has been provided with the
          correct execute attributes for the user account being used.<br />

          <span>Common Agentless FIM Troubleshooting Tips:</span><br />
          <strong><em>'Permission denied'</em></strong> Check file permissions, especially execute
          permissions for the user account to be used by the Change Tracker Proxy Agent<br />
          <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"
            ><img
              class="confluence-embedded-image"

          ><br />
          <strong><em>'No such file or directory'</em></strong> Check that the NNT_Filehash has been
          placed on a path for the user account being used. Use $PATH to show the path variable
          settings for the user account. You can modify the user path by creating a custom.sh shell
          script in /etc/profile.d/ or by modifying /etc/bashrc or /etc/profile but reference the
          appropriate guidance for your platform OS.<br />
          <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"
            ><img

          ><br />
          <strong><em>'error while loading shared libraries'</em></strong> Suggests there may be
          missing dependencies or required libs are not on an executable path for the user account
          being used.<br />
          <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"
            ><img
              class="confluence-embedded-image"
              height="109"
              width="572"

          ><br />
          Check dependencies of NNT Filehash using an ldd NNT_FILEHASH_LINUX_X64<br />
          Here the libstdc++.so.6 file is reported as 'not found', while all other dependencies have
          been located OK.<br />
          Check if libstdc+<span
            >.* is present on the platform to be monitored using command find / -name libstdc</span
          >+.* <br />
          If the file is located then it will be necessary to either copy the file to the standard
          default path, e.g. /usr/bin, or at least create a link from the path to the file <br />
          If the libstdc file is not located on this host, please run the find command on any other
          similar servers, especially any with compiler capabilities. If located, please take a copy
          of the file, move it to all other servers and place it on the /usr/bin path <br />
          if libstdc++ does not exist anywhere within your server estate, then it will be necessary
          to get the binary from the Manufacturer repo or contact support@nntws.com
