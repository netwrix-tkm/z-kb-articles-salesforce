          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Summary:</span></strong> There are many ways
          to stop a running job in StealthAUDIT but there are some ways that can cause issues. This
          article outlines several methods for safely ending a running task.

          <span
            >Many times while running StealthAUDIT jobs there are situations that require a job
            execution to be ended prematurely. Doing so incorrectly can adversely impact the
            console. For instance, rebooting the machine because a running job is being a resource
            hog and slowing down the console can result in the job tree being incomplete when the
            console is next launched. The methods below can be used to gracefully (or not so
            gracefully) stop job executions without adversely impacting the StealthAUDIT
            Console</span
