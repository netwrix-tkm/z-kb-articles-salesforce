            In response to numerous vulnerabilities associated with deprecated cryptographic
            protocols, customers frequently express the need to disable SSL or TLS 1.0/1.1 for
            StealthAUDIT Reporting or Access Information Center. It is important to note that our
            products are constructed atop the Microsoft IIS/SChannel technology stack to power these
            server components.

            For the configuration of the SChannel registry keys, follow the recommendations in this
            article:

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>TIP:</strong> We recommend customers to review the list of ciphers and
            cryptographic algorithms with their internal security teams to understand what
            combination both meets the needs of their security best practices as well as the
            platforms that are required to access our product. Stealthbits recommends disabling SSL
            and TLS 1.0, and 1.1 whenever possible.

            As an alternative to manually manipulating the registry there is a tool called IISCrypt.
            It helps to provide an easy to configure experience for these settings. While the name
            implies that it is targeted at IIS, it also works for our internal webserver. You can
            download the tool here:
