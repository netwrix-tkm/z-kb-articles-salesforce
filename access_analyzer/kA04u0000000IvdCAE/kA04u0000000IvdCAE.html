          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Summary:</span></strong> The StealthAUDIT
          license mechanism is based on the number of rows in host inventory for legacy reasons.
          Because the product is now typically licensed based on count of Active Directory users,
          the banner indicating a problem with licensing can cause concern.

          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong>
          <span
            >User opens the StealthAUDIT Console and the application banner contains the message
            Licensed Host Count Exceeded</span
          >
        </p>

          <span
            ><span
              >This message is generated when someone has added more hosts to their database than
              they have been licensed for. To find out how many hosts an environment is licensed
              for, go to the menu bar and select <strong>Help</strong> &gt;
              <strong>About</strong> in the StealthAUDIT console. This displays  a window that shows
              all licensed modules and a licensed hosts section. This number is controlled by the
              license file.

              >To increase the host count, contact your account manager or email

              >In most cases, there is no associated cost because the product is licensed on a per
              user basis rather than on a per host basis. StealthAUDIT for Windows and StealthAUDIT
              for Systems Governance are notable rare exceptions where licensing may be server-based
              instead of user-based. The error has no impact on functionality of the product, and
              reports will still be generated for all hosts scanned. The only other noticeable
              result of exceeding a host count is that there is a watermark on the published
              report.</span

            ><span
              >Most often, the reason that there are too many hosts is that there is a host
              discovery task that is looking at too broad of a scope such as an IP Sweep or an
              active directory query that looks at every OU instead of a single OU. If this is what
              happened in your environment, you can reach out to
              <a href="mailto:support@stealthbits.com" target="_blank">support@stealthbits.com</a>
              and an engineer can assist you in removing the excess hosts and properly scoping the
              discovery query.

              ><strong>Internal Note:</strong> Even though they may just need a new license file
              with a higher host limit, the number of hosts can be considered a proxy for the size
              of an organization. As such, the "Licensed host count exceeded: message may be an
              indication that a true-up is in order. Perform a health check on the ADInventory job
              group and verify the number of AD Users in production.</span
