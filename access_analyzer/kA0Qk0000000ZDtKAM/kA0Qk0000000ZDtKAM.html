        <h2 id="symptom">Symptom</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            Following the replacement of the original LANSweeper collection job with a new version
            utilizing the ODBC data collector, significant performance degradation and database
            issues were observed.
          </p>

          <p>
            After implementing the new version of the LANSweeper collection job, the runtime of the
            job increased drastically up to 2 hours over couple of days.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="cause">Cause</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            The <b>StealthAUDIT database</b> exhibited numerous queries in a suspended state. These
            suspensions primarily occurred when a query attempted to access a table with a
            write-lock applied due to another query already acting upon it. Additionally, high CPU
            usage and Disk I/O latency were observed, collectively leading to a significant slowdown
            in database transactions.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>

        <div>
          <p>Follow the steps below to resolve the issue:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                The AD_GroupPolicy job, which was identified as a contributing factor to the Disk
                I/O latency, was terminated. This action resulted in a return to normal Disk I/O
                latency levels, although high CPU usage persisted.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Perform Packet Capture (PCAP) on the LANSweeper, Enterprise Auditor, and Enterprise
                Auditor database hosts. Link?
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Regularly monitor system performance metrics to detect and address any emerging
                issues promptly.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Implement job prioritization and optimization strategies to mitigate resource
                contention and improve overall system performance.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Conduct periodic Packet Capture analysis to identify and resolve any network-related
                issues affecting data transmission and integrity.
