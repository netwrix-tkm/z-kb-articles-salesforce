        <div>
          <p>An FSAA job scan attempts to scan non-existing shared folders.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="cause">Cause</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            The method used to determine a resource is deleted was changed âˆ’ the new method
            implements the <strong>LastSeen</strong>/<strong>LastDeleted</strong> values
            calculation. A resource might end up marked as not deleted in T1 if the resource was
            marked as deleted by the permissions scan, but it had subsequent activity. The not
            deleted resources have a deleted mask of <strong>5</strong>, and they do not show up in
            the <strong>ResourceStatus</strong> table with a <strong>LastDeleted</strong> value.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>

        <div>
          <p>Update T1. Refer to the following line:</p>

          <pre
            class="has-inner-focus"
          ><code class="lang-Registry">UPDATE SA_FSAA_Resources SET DeletedUSN = 1000000, ActivityLastDeleted = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE AccessID IS NULL AND DLPID IS NULL AND ActivityLastSeen IS NULL AND ActivityLastDeleted IS NULL AND DeletedUSN IS NULL--- CODE ---</code></pre>

          <blockquote>
            <p>
              <span><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong></span>This method will lead to the deletion of
              every entry not updated to the new <strong>LastSeen</strong>/<strong
                >LastDeleted</strong
              >
              method.
            </p>
          </blockquote>

          <p>
            Inactive resources, or resources out of the permissions scan and DLP scope will be
            marked as deleted.
