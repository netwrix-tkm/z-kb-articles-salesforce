            ><span
              >We updated the version of SQLite with the original 9.0 release to try and stay on the
              latest and greatest of our 3rd party components (which customers usually request we
              do). This addressed potential security concerns, allows us to leverage new features if
              we choose to, and has the potential to increases performance.

              >An additional update was was required in a hotfix early in the 9.0 lifecycle
              <span
                >to address intermittent file system scanning errors that resulted in the following
                error (or similar) being displayed.  "code = Misuse (21), message =
                System.Data.SQLite.SQLiteException: bad parameter or other API misuse. Failed to
                configure managed assembly logging."  (The newer version was needed to turn off
                assembly logging, which we do not leverage, and was required to suppress the
                error.)  This second update in the hotfix does have some minor risk of affecting the
                product if somehow the older DLL is used, however.</span

                files are System.Data.SQLite.dll and SQLite.Interop.dll.  (Note that
                System.Data.SQLite.dll.config is also added, and must exist anywhere

                >A: If there are questions about the version of the DLLs, they should be checked in
                in (Root of) %SAINSTALLDIR% and the Private Assemblies folder.  If the files appear
                in the root %SAINSTALLDIR% folder, the versions there will generally be used in
                preference to files in the specific folders.  Be aware that the Sensitive Data
                Add-on puts new copies of the files in the root %SAINSTALLDIR% on purpose to address
                prior conditions that may have caused the files to be present there.

                >(Informational note: The main StealthAUDIT installer updates the files in the
                Private Assemblies folder.  Jobs will copy the needed files from the Private
                Assemblies if they are newer, so only the root %SAINSTALLDIR% and Private Assembly
                folders need to be checked for updated files.  For example, the FSAA DC copies the
                DLLs from Private Assemblies to the FSAA folder if needed.  The Web folder will also
                potentailly contain the older version of the file, which does not affect product
                functionality.)</span
