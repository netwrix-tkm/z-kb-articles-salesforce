        <p>
          This article explains how to view the security roles assigned to a user in an identity
          store within Netwrix Directory Manager (formerly GroupID). Security roles control the
          access and permissions users have across different Directory Manager clients, such as
          portals, the admin center, and mobile apps. Understanding role assignments helps
          administrators verify user privileges and troubleshoot permission-related issues.
        </p>
        <p>Directory Manager includes built-in roles such as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Administrator:</strong> Full permissions in the identity store.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Helpdesk:</strong> Can reset passwords and unlock accounts (not available for
            Microsoft Entra ID stores).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>User:</strong> Can manage groups, update directory profiles, and handle direct
            reports.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>These roles can be customized or extended with additional custom roles as needed.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            <span class="Note"><strong>NOTE:</strong></span> Roles are only shown for deployed
            clients. For example, if the mobile app is not deployed for the selected identity store,
            it will not appear in the <strong>Client name</strong> list.
          </p>
