          Using Security Roles to Limit Scope of Search
        </h3>

        <div>
          <p>
            GroupID uses RBAC model through which you can define Security Roles and can delegate
            permissions accordingly to different users. We can set GroupID search in such a way that
            AD objects (e.g., Groups, Users, Contacts) can only be searched within a specific OU and
            filtered based on Active Directory attributes.
          </p>

          <p>
            For more information on how to setup a limit on the search scope for a particular
            Security Role, visit the following KB Article:

          <p>
            In GroupID, you can apply policies to security roles, so that role members can use
            GroupID in keeping with the policy restrictions. GroupID’s New Object policy enables you
            to restrict role members to create new groups in a specific OU only.  
          </p>

          <p>
            For more information on how to setup a New Object policy for specific security roles,

          Importing Membership via GroupID Bulk Membership Import Feature for Groups
        </h3>

        <div>
          <p>
            Many times, organizations create groups (Security and Distributions) in advance i.e.,
            before the actual usage of groups. To avoid any critical information being leaked out,
            it is recommended that such groups be created without populating membership upon its
            creation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Instead, you can use the <b>Bulk Import Membership</b> feature of GroupID to update
            groups with the correct memberships just before their actual usage starts. Bulk import
            allows for external source files like a CSV or an Excel Sheet to import membership when
            it is needed.
          </p>

          <p>
            In GroupID, bulk import of memberships is possible using the Import Wizard available in
            GroupID Portal. Following KB Article provides step-by-step instructions to bulk import
            members in a group.

          Creating Smart Group Without Updating Memberships
        </h3>

        <div>
          <p>
            Another way to ensure that the group memberships do not update beforehand, if a group
            has been created in advance, is by just previewing the query results of a Smart group
            without updating the group memberships. 
          </p>

          <p>
            A query based dynamic "<em>smart group</em>" is one whose membership is determined by
            the supplied criteria. The results can be previewed but not acted upon until needed.
             Keeping out of update schedule ensures only when manually updated that membership is
            updated.

          Keep Group Hidden from GAL Until it is Ready to be Used
        </h3>

        <div>
          <p>
            Keeping a group and its membership hidden from discoverability from external tools like
            Outlook can also help comply to organizational policies for ensuring secrecy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using GroupID Portal, if a mail-enabled group is created, we can hide the Group and its
            membership from Address Book and GAL in the following way.
          </p>

          Selecting Appropriate Security Type for Groups
        </h3>

        <div>
          <p>
            During the creation of a group via GroupID Portal, the security type can be designated
            as Private, Semi-Private, or Public. This classification, serving as a pseudo attribute
            within GroupID, governs the permission levels for joining the group. It is always
            recommended to choose Private as the Security Type for Sensitive Groups.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Private</b> – A closed group where the group owner solely determines group
                membership.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <b>Semi-Private</b> – The group owner approves users' requests to join or leave the
                group.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><b>Public</b> – An open group that anyone can join or leave.</p>
            </li>

        <h3 id="setting_up_delivery_restrictions_on_mail-enabled_groups">
          Setting up Delivery Restrictions on Mail-Enabled Groups
        </h3>

        <div>
          <p>
            It is always recommended to ensure/limit the inflow of Email Messages received by the
            critical groups with the production environment. GroupID allows you to set Delivery
            Restrictions on such groups by leveraging the <b>AuthOrig</b> and
            <b>UnAuthOrig</b> attributes from Active Directory. Both Self-Service and Automate give
            Group Owners and Administrators the ability to set rules for Accepting/Rejecting Emails
            from certain users for a particular group.
          </p>

          <p>
            To set Delivery Restrictions via GroupID portal, simply search for the Group and
            navigate to <b>Delivery Restriction</b> tab in <b>Group Properties</b>.

          Setting up Approver Workflows for the Creation of New Groups
        </h3>

        <div>
          <p>
            One of the most efficient methods to effectively manage the number/quality of groups
            being created by end users is the implementation of a continuous monitoring process
            where Admins can approve the group being created.
          </p>

          <p>
            GroupID allows you to setup customized workflow approval processes with tailored filters
            to cater to use case specific triggering. This process ensures that whenever a group is
            created an approval request is sent to concerned Authorities for approval.  
          </p>

          <p>
            For more information of implementing such workflows, visit the following KB Article.

          <p>
            Another way to ensure that no unauthorized message is sent to critical groups,
            administrators can setup moderator approval processes for Microsoft Exchange. GroupID
            can be easily customized to provide the necessary attributes in the Group Properties
            visible on the portal to initiate a Message Approval process and assign moderators for
            certain critical DLs.
