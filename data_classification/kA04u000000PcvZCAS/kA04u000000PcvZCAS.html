          The following article details steps for backing up the NDC index. The reason for backing
          up the NDC index is to provide a safety net in case of index corruption. Having a properly
          maintained NDC index can reduce the time lost in the event that an index is corrupted.
        </p>

        <p><b>What causes index corruption?</b></p>

        <p>Corruption within the index occurs when one of two situations occurs:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            The Indexer process is terminated without being allowed to stop gracefully, perhaps by a
            power interruption or the use of the “End Task” option in Task Manager
          </li>
          <li>
            The Indexer is prevented from editing the files by some other utility (Ransomware
            protection, Anti-Virus etc) during that same window (or, the utility changes those files
            itself).
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>How to prevent the index from corrupting?</b></p>

        <ol>
          <li>Ensure that automatic restarts have been disabled on the server</li>
          <li>
            Ensure that the CSE files have been excluded from any running Anti-Virus. (Default CSE
            location: <i>C:\Program Files\ConceptSearching\ConceptDB\</i>)
          </li>
          <li>Educate users of the NDC product to avoid manually stopping the indexer process.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><b>My index has corrupted, can I perform a root cause analysis?</b></p>

        <p>
          Yes, logs are generally the best method for this but if considerable time has passed then
          it may be tricky. One option would be to review the following SQL data:
        </p>

        <pre><i>SELECT * FROM ApplicationLog WHERE Operation = 1 AND ModuleID = 2 ORDER BY LogDateTime DESC</i></pre>

        <p>
          If the service was improperly shutdown then you would expect to have a “<b>Started</b>”
          entry without a corresponding “<b>Shutdown</b>” entry.
        </p>

        <p><b>How to back up the index?</b></p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Stop all services (<b>Collector</b>, <b>Indexer</b>, <b>Classifier</b>). If you are
            using a DQS (clustered NDC), stop all three services on each server in the cluster.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take a backup of the CSE file folder on each server. (Default CSE location:
            <i>C:\Program Files\ConceptSearching\ConceptDB\</i>)
          </li>
          <li>
            Take a backup of the SQL database (it’s very important that the SQL database is in sync
            with the CSE files – hence stopping the services first)
          </li>
          <li>Start all services</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          For best results, taking these steps weekly will ensure that minimal data is lost in the
          event of an index corruption.
