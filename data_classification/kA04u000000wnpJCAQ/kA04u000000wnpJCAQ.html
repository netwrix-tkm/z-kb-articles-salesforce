        <h2 id="symptom">Symptom</h2>

        <div>
          <p>The following warning appears in Netwrix Data Classification:</p>

          <pre
            class="has-inner-focus"
          ><code class="lang-Registry">Indexer service has been improperly shutdown.</code></pre>
        </div>

        <h2 id="cause">Cause</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            This message occurs if the Indexer service has been forcibly stopped, such as by
            <b>Task Manager</b> -&gt; <b>End Task, </b>or via a machine restart.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2 id="resolution">Resolution</h2>

        <div>
          <p>
            To identify the root cause of the issue, open the lock files in the lock archive and
            check the date and time of the last recorded activity:
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                On the computer that hosts Netwrix Data Classification, navigate to the lock archive
                location.
              </p>

              <p>
                The location of the lock archive should be called out in the warning message, but
                the default location is
                <em>C:\Program Files\Netwrix\Data Classification\Index\LockArchive</em>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Open the Lock Archive with a text editor, such as <b>Notepad</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Find the date and time of the last recorded activity. This will help you to
                understand when the indexer was shutdown improperly.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Review the <b>Windows Application</b> logs to look for potential causes, such as a
                machine reboot, and speak to any users who were logged on to the machine at that
                time and may know what was happening.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                When the cause has been identified, you can resolve the issue. Use suspended
                services if your machine did automatic Windows updates.
