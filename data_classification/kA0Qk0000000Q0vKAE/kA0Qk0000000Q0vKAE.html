        <div>
          <p>
            Go to the workflow logs (<code>https://[YourNDCServerName]/NDC/Workflows/Logs</code>)
            and check the status:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                If it's <strong>negative</strong>, then there was an error. Enable collector tracing
                and reindex the file, then view the event logs for details of the issue. You will
                usually see either the PageID, PageURL, or both in the logs to know which errors are
                related.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                If it's less than 400, it means that it is not classified and needs to finish
                processing first. Check codes in the

              <p>
                If the status is <strong>Classified (400) </strong> and the
                <strong>ReindexStatus</strong> is 3, then it means it hasn't been reindexed or
                reclassified. This means that a change was detected or the user manually requested
                reprocessing. Give NDC time to reprocess the document.

              <p>
                If the status is 400 and the reindex status is 0, check the
                <strong>Text</strong> and <strong>Metadata</strong> tabs. This is an easy way to
                confirm issues where Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has failed to extract the
                text you're looking for or if there was an issue processing text extraction for the
                document. If it doesn't match, enable collector tracing and reindex the document for
                details in the logs.

            If it has the expected text and metadata, investigate why the expected
            classification/term is not present on the document:

            <li>
              <p>Make a note of the <strong>PageId</strong>.</p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Navigate to <strong>Taxonomies</strong> and select the taxonomy you need to
                diagnose.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Click the <strong>Search</strong> tab and then select <strong
                  >Add custom filter</strong
                >.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Select the <strong>Include documents (PageIds)</strong> filter type and type in the
                PageId of the document you wish to check and then click <strong>Add</strong> &gt;
                <strong>Search</strong>.
              </p>

              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  <strong>TIP:</strong> The document should be shown. If it is not, then check to
                  see if security trimming is enabled and hiding the document.
                </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Click on the calculator icon. This will confirm which clues matched and if any
                filters have been applied.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                See if the details shown differ from what is expected. You should understand why you
                expect this document to be classified, so you will see certain matching clues. By
                comparing the expectations to the results in the classification debug, you can
                identify which clues are not matching as expected. You may also notice if a
                mandatory clue hasn't been matched and then adjust the clues accordingly.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If the document shows as classified in the calculations dialog but is not shown as
                classified in the page info dialog, then it's possible that the taxonomy clues have
                changed since the document was last classified.
              </p>

              <p>
                Select the document, select <strong>Re-classify</strong>, and then select
                <strong>Reset Cache</strong> &gt; <strong>Ok</strong>. Then, observe whether the
                status of the document changes to <strong>Reclassified</strong>, and then recheck
                the page info classifications tab.
