              >The first table contains a list of very common words (such as: “and”, “it” and “the”
              in English) that contribute very little to the searching process. These words are
              completely removed from the index reducing its size significantly.</span

              but is excluded from compound (i.e. multi-word) terms. This list typically includes
              common prepositions, conjunctions, and adverbs for each of the supported
              languages.</span

              being added or removed from either list. In general, a word removed from the Stoplist
              table should be moved into the StoplistExpand table.</span

              particular language. Also, all stopwords should be entered with appropriate diacritics
              since all stopword processing is based on the extended ASCII character set.</span

              appropriate SQL editor such as Microsoft’s Query Analyser. A future version of Netwrix
              Data Classification will provide a graphical front-end utility to manage all system
