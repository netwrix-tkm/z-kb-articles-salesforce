        <div>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>Please make sure that the workflow is enabled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Go to the <strong>Log</strong> section and check if there were attempts to run the
                workflow for the document. Depending on the result, follow one of the instructions
                below:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>There was a successful attempt to run the workflow</strong> – Check the
                    workflow action configuration. Then enable workflow trace logging and reclassify
                    the document. Check the Windows Event Logs for details of any issues. (e.g.,
                    skipping redaction because the file type isn't supported).
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Failed to run the workflow</strong> – A basic error message will be
                    displayed that may assist you with troubleshooting the issue. If it doesn't give
                    enough details, then enable workflow trace logging and reclassify the document.
                    Check the Windows Event Logs for details of any issues.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <strong>No attempts to run the workflow</strong> – Check that the conditions are
                    configured correctly for the workflow and workflow rule. If the workflow and
                    workflow rules are configured correctly, then check the classifications of the
                    document. If the classifications aren't as expected, then please reference to
                    the following documentation for the troubleshooting steps:

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Filter the workflow logs and check if there are other workflows being run for the
                document. Workflows run in a priority order. If there is more than one migration
                action, then the second migration will fail as the document has already been moved.

          <p>
            This typically means that the document has a classification that isn't expected to have
            or that the conditions in the workflow rule are not configured correctly.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Check the workflow rule conditions. Pay attention to the parameters. Learn more
                about rule configuration and description of classification rules:

                Check the document's classifications. If there is a classification that is not
