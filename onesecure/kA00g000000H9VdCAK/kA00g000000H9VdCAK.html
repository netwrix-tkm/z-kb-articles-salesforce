            Why is the <strong>Workstation</strong> field returned as <strong>unknown</strong> in

          <p>This could be caused by one of the following reasons:</p>
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The data collecting account used in the affected monitoring plan does not have access
              to the domain controller. This could be related to the format the account is specified
              in, or permissions granted to the account. For additional information on permissions,
              refer to the following article:

            <p>
              Warnings for AD auditing are related to the Originating Workstation feature. Netwrix
              Auditor (NA) and Netwrix 1Secure collect user logon and logoff events to identify the
              user session for the change as no data on a specific workstation to introduce a change
              to AD in Security events on domain controllers is usually indicated. This workflow can
              be inaccurate as there might be several open sessions on different workstations for a
              single user, or no recent logons or logoffs events on workstations registered. This
              warning is expected and doesn't affect general data collection—in this case it can be
              safely ignored.
            </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Security log overwrites. For example, a user logged to the workstation from which a
              change was made before NA or 1Secure was installed, and log overwrites occurred before
              the product ran the first data collection. For instructions on how to configure the
              Security event log size and retention policy to prevent log overwrites, refer to
              <a

              System Health log.

              Audit policies are configured incorrectly. You can configure them automatically in NA
              or 1Secure or manually. For instructions, refer to

            <p>
              The change to the audited domain was made through the interface of Exchange Server
              installed in a different domain.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The change to the audited domain was made through Exchange Management Shell with the
              impersonation of another user's account. For example, a user logged to a workstation
              under their account and then opened a different session through Exchange Management
              Shell which enabled them to perform operations by using the permissions associated
              with another user's account.
            </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Native Windows logon events lack the information on the IP address of the originating
              workstation.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The change was made under a computer account (e.g., computer password resets, account
              lockouts, changes to Service Principal names, etc.). This is the most popular reason.
              In order to confirm it, check the <strong>Who</strong> field of the corresponding
              change—if the account name ends with '$'—this is a computer account and the
              workstation is expected to be 'unknown'.
