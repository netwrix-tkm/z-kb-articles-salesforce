## Overview

This article covers the troubleshooting steps to follow in case of successful data collection in 1Secure. It also includes a description of the `Cache` folder contents. 

##  Successful data collection − Analyze the Cache folder 

The activities collected by 1Secure are processed via the `Cache` folder. The folder is located in `C:\ProgramData\Netwrix Cloud Agent\NAProcessor\Cache`. The `Cache` folder includes the following folders: 

  * `Failed`. The folder contains activities which could be converted from the connector format to the cloud format. If activities are stuck in the folder, escalate the case to the R&D team. 

> **IMPORTANT:** Include the `C:\ProgramData\Netwrix Cloud Agent\Logs\CloudAgentCoreSvc\NAPHandler.log` file in the escalation. 

  * `Tmp`. The folder collects activities before they are sent to 1Secure. 

  * `Del`. The folder contains activities successfully sent to 1Secure. The folder is cleared once per minute (i.e., the retention cycle equals 1 minute). 

  * `Ready`. The folder contains activities to be uploaded to 1Secure. If activities are stuck in the folder, escalate the case to the R&D team. 

> **IMPORTANT:** Include the contents of the `C:\ProgramData\Netwrix Cloud Agent\Logs\CloudAgentCoreSvc` log folder in the escalation.
