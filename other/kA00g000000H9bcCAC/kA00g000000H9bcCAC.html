        I deployed the Password Manager client on several machines and on some of them I receive the
        following error at startup

        />

        <hr />

        The application adds files to Program files and keys to the registry, also registers its
        components in registry. The error above occurs because some of required components were not
        installed or registered. The most common reason is the lack of permissions granted to the
        account under which the client was installed. Microsoft User Account Control (UAC) can also
        cause this.

        <hr />

        First of all make sure that the account used to deploy the client has full access to the
        local system (local admin permissions or local system account). Try perform the deployment
        with UAC disabled. If the issue persists, please manually check that after deployment of the
        client the following registry keys exist.
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREPoliciesNetWrixPasswordManager
        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREWow6432NodePoliciesNetwrixPasswordManager (this is only in 64-bit
        OS)

        <img

          alt="User-added image"
        />

        If the key does not exist you can create it manually. No values are necessary. Change the
        deployment procedure to create this key.
