        When enrolling a user, the following error occurs: Enrollment failed: cannot save secret

        <hr />

        Password Manager is trying to create a secrets.bin file in the Password Manager installation
        directory. The account used for the Password Manager service does not have proper access
        writes to the Password Manager installation directory.

        <hr />

        <ol>
          <li>
            Provide the Password Manager service account rights with Modify and/or Write to the
            Password Manager installation directory.
          </li>
          <li>
            Verify that the account is a domain admin and a local administrator on the Netwrix
            server where Password Manager is installed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Verify the Administrators group on the Netwrix server has Modify/Write access to the
            Password Manager installation directory.
          </li>
