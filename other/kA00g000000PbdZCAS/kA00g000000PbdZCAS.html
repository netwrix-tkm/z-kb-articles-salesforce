        When a user attempts to reset password and fails to provide a password which corresponds to
        the password policy, the "User must change password at next logon" option will be
        automatically enabled for this user.

        <hr />

        Due to the way it works, Netwrix Password Manager cannot reset a password to a new value
        directly, because this procedure requires the user's current password, and the software does
        not know it. Therefore, the Password Manager first resets the password to a random one and
        only after that changes it to a new value. This two-step procedure is required because the
        Security Policies apply only during a password change, not a password reset operation.
        Therefore, it is not possible to select some of the password policies, for example, password
        history. The issue is replicated with the following scenario: 1. "Use AD password policy
        settings" option is <strong>enabled</strong> in the <strong>Admin porta</strong>l -&gt;
        <strong>Domains</strong> -&gt; <strong>Edit </strong>Managed Domain. 2. A user performs a
        reset password operation. In Password Manager it's a 3-step procedure: - password is reset
        to a random value - new password is checked for AD password policy compliance - if the new
        password does not pass the check, it stays random and "user must change password at next
        logon" option is enabled automatically 3. User fails to provide the password which complies
        with password policy. According to the previous step, the user's old password is no longer
        valid (was reset to random) and new password was not applied. Similar behavior occurs during
        Change password procedure, but password is not get reset to a random one, so just "User must
        change password at next logon" checkbox gets enabled.

        <hr />

        To prevent this issue, you can disable the "<strong>Use AD password policy settings</strong
        >" option (<strong>Admin Portal</strong> -&gt; <strong>Domains</strong>-&gt;
        <strong>Edit</strong>) and configure the password policy through Netwrix Password Manager
        (<strong>Admin Portal</strong> -&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>-&gt;
        <strong>Password Policy</strong> tab).
