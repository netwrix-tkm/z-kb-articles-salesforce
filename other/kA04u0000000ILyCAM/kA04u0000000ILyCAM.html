<p>An issue has been identified in Change Tracking that causes conflicts when upgrading to SA 10.0. This issue was due to outdated xml files in the out of the box solutions that have recently been updated with 10.0. <br/> We have addressed this fix for future upgrades.</p>
<p>However, in order to limit any issues that may arise with any customer that plans to upgrade in the future, a tool has been created to fix change files to be compatible for upgrades.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We recommend current customers on 9.0 and 10.0 that have not yet experienced this issue to run this tool prior to any future upgrade.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Customers that have already upgraded to 10.0 and experienced this issue should run this tool prior to any future upgrade.</strong></p>
