        <p><strong>Summary: </strong></p>
        <p>
          StealthAUDIT History Retention is enabled by default in the File System solution set but
          no other solution sets or collection jobs. This is due to the way the solution sets write
          their collected data back to the StealthAUDIT database.

        <p>
          At the global level, StealthAUDIT History retention is disabled and should not be enabled
          in almost all implementations. Individual solution sets or custom solutions can have their
          history enabled at the solution level; however, you must understand how StealthAUDIT
          History works to understand if you can or should enable it. History works by retaining
          data within data collector result tables based on its configuration. Most solution sets,
          besides a few, rely on the data collector results table to do their analysis and
          reporting. Preserving more than just the most recent set of data in these tables can
          result in inflated or duplicated data in reports.
        </p>

        <p>
          History can be enabled to preserve data for a specific time period or set number of times
          the job runs.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, StealthAUDIT History Retention is enabled by default in the File System
          solution set, this is because the collection jobs in the solution set write to a managed
          schema (e.g., SA_FSAA_* tables) as well as the data collector results table (e.g.,
          SA_1-FSAA_System_Scans_Access).
        </p>
        <p><img src="kA04u0000000HsDCAU_4acfa414-c977-4ef4-95eb-7e7d4b9a04cf.png" alt="" /></p>
        <p>
          History can be enabled for the collection jobs in this solution set because the out of the
          box reporting within the File System solution leverages the managed schema tables and not
          the data collector results table. History is enabled here so you can identify how the job
          has performed over the last 5 runs, as the data collector results table contains
          summarized information around runtime, types and amount of data collected, etc. Being able
          to report and analyze on trends of your collection jobs is possible through StealthAUDIT
          History.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two other solution sets that can support history at the collection level are .Active
          Directory Inventory and SharePoint. That is because these two solution sets also write to
          a managed schema, (e.g., SA_ADInventory_* and SA_SPAA_*) which the out of the box reports
          rely on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two examples of solution sets that should never have their history enabled would be the
          Active Directory Permissions Analyzer and Windows solutions. These solutions leverage data
          collectors that write their collected data directly to the data collector results tables.
          If you were to enable history, the out of the box reports would contain duplicated data.
