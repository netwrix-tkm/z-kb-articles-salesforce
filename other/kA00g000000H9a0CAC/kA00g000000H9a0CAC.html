        After installation of Netwrix Password manager client (Logon prompt extension) it is not
        possible to log on to the system. There are no options on the logon screen except Netwrix
        assistant

        <hr />

        To allow users reset passwords from the logon screen, Password Manager client adds its own
        credential providers. There are two options for this - a link under the logon field, or an
        additional icon available after 'Other credentials' is pressed. During the deployment of the
        link to the logon screen, default password providers get disabled and replaced with the
        Netwrix provider. More details on this can be found in the
        <a href="https://kb.netwrix.com/2090" target="_blank">KB2090</a>

        Such issue can occur when some third-party software blocks the Netwrix credential provider
        from successful deployment.

        <hr />

        To restore the logon screen, you will need to access the computer registry, for example, by
        means of the Remote Registry service
        <ol>
          <li>
            Run <strong>regedit</strong> on another machine with credentials of an account that has
            local admin permissions on the problematic machine.
          </li>
          <li>Select <strong>File - Connect network registry</strong></li>
          <li>Specify the problematic computer name</li>
          <li>
            When remote registry is connected, expand %servername%<strong
              >HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionAuthenticationCredential
              Providers{6f45dc1e-5384-457a-bc13-2cd81b0d28ed}</strong
            >
          </li>
          <li>Change the <strong>Disabled </strong>DWORD value to 0, or simply delete the value</li>
        </ol>
        <img

        />

        Alternatively you can restart the computer in safe mode. The most common reason for Netwrix
        credential provider deployment to fail is Credential provider Filters installed by
        third-party vendors. The list of filters can be found at the
        <strong

          Filters </strong
