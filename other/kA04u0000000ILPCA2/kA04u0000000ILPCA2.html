          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Summary:</span></strong> FPolicy by itself
          is an expensive technology. It has significant impact on I/O performance.  FPolicy is a
          NetApp service that we simply integrate with as an event subscriber.  It can be a
          performance-intensive feature to enable and NetApp will tell you as much.  We advise a
          crawl/walk/run approach to avoid any impact to production services.

            FPolicy by itself is an expensive technology. It has significant impact on I/O
            performance.
          </div>
          <div>
            A prospect (now a customer) has run extensive performance tests during POC, two models
            of NetApp devices vs. SAM.
          </div>
          <div> </div>
          <div>
            To test this, we developed a high-performance, stripped down version of SAM (Test
            FPolicy Utility) to prove that SAM was not a culprit of performance issues. This Test
            FPolicy Utility is a fast C++ implementation (similar to SAM's FPolicy service) that
            just receives messages and discards them immediately without any parsing or processing.

                  The idea was to measure maximum possible throughput. Luckily SAM was close to the
                  tool's figures. We've used the tool in two instances

          <div>Case #1. POC</div>
          <div class="copy-paste-block">
            <div>With FPolicy disabled: 22K events/second</div>
            <div>With FPolicy enabled: 8K events/second</div>
            <div>
              Tested both with SAM and custom built high performance tool. Activity was distributed
              across 4 SAM Agents.

            <div>Case #2. Customer</div>
            <div>
              <div>
                Customer had many performance issues. On the most busiest filers (usual load of 5
                million events/hour with bursts up to 20 million/hour) they had to limit the
                monitored operations to creates, deletes, and renames only.

                      Just try to explain that FPolicy is a NetApp service that we simply integrate
                      with as an event subscriber. It can be a performance-intensive feature to
                      enable and NetApp will tell you as much. It’s also independent of the vendor.
                      Stealthbits and Varonis and anyone else will have similar impacts if
                      configured similarly.

                      We advise a crawl/walk/run approach to avoid any impact to production

                      <li>Think about what your requirements are.</li>
                      <li>Do you really need to monitor read events?</li>
                      <li>Are there any shares or volumes you absolutely need to monitor?</li>
                      <li>
                        Any shares or volumes you expect to have automated processes or applications
                        that can be excluded?

                      At the risk of mixing metaphors, opening the floodgates can be a valid and
                      necessary exercise, but you don’t want to open them all at once if you don’t
                      know how much higher the water level is on the other side of the gate.

                      All of the commands are in our documentation, they just have to replace with
                      SVM names and scope of events to screen for and locations to monitor they
                      need. They may not know where to start though. NetApp has “worksheets” in the
                      sub-nodes of this documentation that’ll help you / them guide what kind of a
                      configuration they want.
