        I get the following error in Enrollment wizard.

        <hr />

        The error occurs when Enrollment wizard is not able to connect to the Password Manager
        server. Error code can be different - 12037, 12038, 12029, 12044 It can happen due to
        several reasons but the most common reasons for this error are an incorrect path to the
        Password Manager Self-Service Portal or incorrect SSL-settings if you are using HTTPS.

        <hr />

        To resolve the issue: 1. Check that URL of the Password Manager Server is specified
        correctly. The URL of the server is determined by the registry value called
        <strong>PRM_Server</strong>. There are two registry keys containing this value:
        <ol>
          <li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARE[Wow6432Node]PoliciesNetwrixPassword Manager</li>
          <li>
            HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWARE[Wow6432Node]NetwrixPassword Manager Self-service Client
          </li>
        </ol>
        <strong>NOTE.</strong> Wow6432Node for 64-bit OS only The key 1 is determined by Group
        policy. If there is no PRM_Serer value in the key 1, then the value from the key 2 is used.
        Make sure that the specified value has correct URL.

        2. Verify SSL settings.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure you are able to browse to the Password Manager Self-service portal without any
            warnings. Please refer to
            <a href="https://kb.netwrix.com/610" target="_blank">this article</a> if there are
            warnings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure that SSL settings for PM virtual directory are set to
            <strong>Ignore client certificates</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
