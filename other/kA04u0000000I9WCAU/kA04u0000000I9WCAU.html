          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Summary:</span></strong> Covers performance
          best practices for joining and filtering on calculated columns in ADInventory and Data
          Governance Views
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong> Something to keep in
          mind - NTAccount ('Domain\SAMAccountName') is a calculated value in the Data Governance
          and ADInventory views, so joining on it is very slow. It's actually something like this in
          the background:<br /> <br /><span
            ><span
              >SA_ADInventory_Domains<span>.</span>Name<span>+</span><span>'\'</span
              ><span>+</span>SA_ADInventory_Principals<span>.</span>SamAccountName</span
            ></span
          ><br /> <br />In situations where you need to join or filter based on calculated columns,
          it's better to join on IDs if you can, and on the parts that make up the column if you
          can't get the IDs easily. If joining a "natural" (non-calculated) column to a calculated
          column that's a concatenation of other columns, making a temp table with the pieces of the
          concatenation is a good first step, and will typically be faster than joining on the
          calculated column - especially for a large dataset.<br />

          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Instructions:</span></strong> Here's the
          substring to split up domain and username when given 'Domain\SAMAccountName' format:<br /> <br /><span
            ><span><span>select</span></span></span
          ><br /><span
            ><span>      <span>'DOMAIN\John.Smith'</span></span></span
          ><br /><span
            ><span><span>,</span></span></span
          ><span
            ><span
              >     <span>SUBSTRING</span><span>(</span><span>'DOMAIN\John.Smith'</span
              ><span>,</span>1<span>,(</span><span>CHARINDEX</span><span>(</span><span>'\'</span
              ><span>,</span><span>'DOMAIN\John.Smith</span><span>,</span>1<span>)-</span>1<span
                >))</span
              >
              <span>as</span> SCADomain</span
            ></span
          ><br /><span
            ><span><span>,</span></span></span

            ><span
              >      <span>SUBSTRING</span><span>(</span><span>'DOMAIN\John.Smith'</span
              ><span>,(</span><span>CHARINDEX</span><span>(</span><span>'\'</span><span>,</span
              ><span>'DOMAIN\John.Smith</span><span>,</span>1<span>)+</span>1<span>),</span
              ><span>LEN</span><span>(</span><span>'DOMAIN\John.Smith</span><span>))</span>
              <span>as</span> SCASamAccountName</span
            ></span
          ><br /> <br /> Looking at the execution plan to compare the two versions, joining on the
          concatenated value was 99% compared to 1% when joining the two columns. In lab tests with
          a limited dataset, my join on calculated columns took 3 seconds. Joining on two columns
          was 1% of the batch and the time to insert was negligible. Here's a scaled down,
          simplified example you can try in your lab after running ADInventory that shows how the
          two compare. The exact ratio of performance of the two queries in the batch may vary based
          on the contents of your database:<br /> <br /><span
            ><span><span>select</span></span></span
          ><span
            ><span><span> NTAccount </span></span></span

            ><span><span>from</span></span></span

            ><span><span> SA_ADInventory_PrincipalsView </span></span></span

          ><span
            ><span><span> NTAccount</span></span></span
          ><span
            ><span><span>=</span></span></span

          /><br /> <br /> <br /><span
            >Moral of the story: <strong>never, ever</strong> join on <u>NTAccount</u> or
            <u>TrusteeNTStyleName</u> in standard views unless you have absolutely no choice, or the
            environment is small enough that you don't have to worry about performance. </span
          >If you're working on something custom for a smaller environment, please take the time to
          join "the right way" so the solution is scalable in other environments (or as the
          environment grows).<br /> <br /><strong>Other examples:</strong><br /> <br />CN -<br />Similarly,
          CN is also a calculated value based on the DistinguishedName of the AD object (the "Value"
          column in the SA_ADInventory_DistinguishedNames table).<br /> <br /><span
            ><span><span>SUBSTRING</span></span></span
          ><span
            ><span><span>(</span></span></span
          ><span
            ><span
              >dn<span>.</span>Value<span>,</span> 4<span>,</span> <span>PATINDEX</span
              ><span>(</span><span>'%[^\,],%'</span><span>,</span>dn<span>.</span>Value<span
                >)</span
              >
              <span>-</span> 3<span>)</span></span
            ></span
          ><br /> <br />Unfortunately, CN is not being collected anywhere else, so there is no
          substitute for it as far as I know. so grab a coffee if you need to join on CN with a big
          dataset. Or maybe consider collecting it in the Extended Attributes table and joining back
          to the other AD data on PrincipalID. That might be faster.<br /> <br /> <br />
