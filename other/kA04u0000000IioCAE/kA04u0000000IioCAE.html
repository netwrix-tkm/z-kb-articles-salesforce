          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Summary:</span></strong> The
          SG_InstalledApplications uses a WMI class known to cause performance issues on target
          systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong> Microsoft recommends
          against using the Win32_Product class, since it causes performance issues on target
          machines by triggering consistency checks of the installed applications. This not only
          causes performance issues, but goes against the principles of read-only auditing,
          especially since failed consistency checks may result in changes being done outside of
          client maintenance windows.<br /> <br />From Microsoft:<br />"On Windows Server 2003,
          Windows Vista, and newer operating systems, querying Win32_Product will trigger Windows
          Installer to perform a consistency check to verify the health of the application. This
          consistency check could cause a repair installation to occur. You can confirm this by
          checking the Windows Application Event log. You will see the following events each time
          the class is queried and for each product installed"<br /> <br /><strong
            >"If you have an application that makes use of the above class, please contact the
            vendor to get an updated version that does not use this class."</strong
          ><br /> <br />Win32_product Class is not query optimized. Queries such as "select * from
          Win32_Product where (name like 'Sniffer%')" require WMI to use the MSI provider to
          enumerate all of the installed products and then parse the full list sequentially to
          handle the "where" clause. This process also initiates a consistency check of packages
          installed, verifying and repairing the install. With an account with only user privileges,
          as the user account may not have access to quite a few locations, may cause delay in
          application launch and an event 11708 stating an installation failure.<br /> <br /><a

          - article that describes the issue in more detail and proposes an alternative approach
          (registry), which is similar to the collection used in the Applications_Installed instant
          job<br />

        <p>
          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Instructions:</span></strong> Recommend
          disabling/removing this job until it's updated to collect the info using another method or
          class. The the Applications_Installed instant job is a good surrogate, but has its own
          issues as of the time of this KB (11/9/2018), as documented in Escalation 29155.
