Also, the Table in the Scheduled Actions node is currently sorted based on the name of the item being scheduled. If an individual job is being scheduled, it will be sorted based on the name of that job, or if a group is being scheduled, it would be based on the name of the group. We would like this to change so that it is sorted based on the Target so that it is consistent with the way that our jobs in the jobs tree are sorted</p><p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong> YouTrack/Escalations <br/><br/>- SMPC-1315/9751: Enhancement - The sorting scheduled tasks by "Next Run" doesn't correctly order the tasks by date. <br/>- SMPC-1316/9752: Enhancement - On opening the Scheduled Actions view, can the jobs be ordered by Target. <br/><br/>Customers <br/>- Deutsche Bank <br/><br/>Cumulative List of fixes included since Service Pack: <br/>?
