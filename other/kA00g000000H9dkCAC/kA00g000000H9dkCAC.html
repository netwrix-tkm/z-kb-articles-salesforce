        <div>
          <p><strong>Q1: Are the verification questions/security answers encrypted?</strong></p>

          <p>
            A1: The verification questions are public, and they are stored in the plain text format.
            The secret answers are encrypted with the one-way MD5 hash function.

              >Q2: When logging into the Password Manager Helpdesk Portal, is there a way to input
              the AD user name without adding the domain name as a prefix?
            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            A2: Netwrix Password Manager Helpdesk Portal relies on Windows Authentication, which
            requires the domain name to be entered, not just the user name.

            <strong
              >Q3: Does the licensing for Password Manager include the Microsoft Windows Logon GINA
              Extension?
            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            A3: The license for the Password Manager software includes the Windows Logon GINA
            extension.
          </p>
        </div>
         

        <div>
          <p><strong>Q4: Does Password Manager support 2048 bit encryption on SSL? </strong></p>

          <p>
            A4: Yes, if your web browser and IIS server support it. The GINA extension uses the
            Microsoft Internet Explorer engine to communicate with the web server, so the support of
            2048-bit encryption on SSL totally depends on the version of IE installed in the system.

              not work.
            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            A5: By design, any changes to the Admin, Helpdesk and Self-Service shortcuts are
            disabled. Delete the old shortcuts and manually create new ones.

          </p>

          <p>
            A6: This message indicates that all options on the User Options tab of the Settings in
            the Administrative Portal are disabled. To resolve this issue, enable these options as

          <p>

          <p><strong>Q9: How do I upgrade Netwrix Password Manager to a newer version? </strong></p>

          <p>
            A9: To upgrade Netwrix Password Manager to a newer product version, simply run the
            installer. It will upgrade all system files automatically. Note that the installer only
            updates the default files and folders, and ignores files and folders added manually. If
            you have a non-standard configuration (for example, you have two Self-Service Portals
            with a separate folder for the second portal which was created manually), you will have
            to update the files in the non-default folder by copying them manually.

            <strong
              >Q10: How does Netwrix Password Manager handle expired accounts? Will the product
              reset or extend them?
            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            A10: The product does not do anything to expired accounts. Netwrix Password Manager will
            simply display a message that an account has expired.
          </p>
        </div>

          <p>
            <strong
              >Q11: When I enter the new license, the user counter is reset. Do I lose my previously
              counted users?
            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            A11: Netwrix Password Manager license counts active users (per username). When users
            perform any operation (enroll, reset password, unlock account) via Password Manager,
            they are counted. Your users were counted during the enroll procedure. When you enter
            the new license, the counter is reset. The users will be counted again, if they perform
            any action, so neither the users' nor enroll information is lost.
          </p>

            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            A12: Starting from Netwrix Password Manager version 6.2.676, there is an option to save
            reports in CSV format. To do this, in Help-Desk portal, click the Download report button
            next to Generate Report.

            </strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            A15: Starting from the version 6.2.774 of Netwrix Password Manager, there is a similar

          <p>
            A17: Computers do not get enrolled, users do. Data is stored locally on the Password
