<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong> Instructions for how to take a process dump of StealthAUDIT. This can be applied to other processes, as well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Instructions:</span></strong> If you need to create a process dump so that development can diagnose a misbehaving process, please read on:<br/> <br/><strong><u>How to take a process dump</u></strong><br/>I will cover three methods: (in order of preference) </p>
<ol><li>Use procdump.exe (<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/dd996900.aspx" target="_blank">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/dd996900.aspx</a>). This works on all systems and gets a little bit more information than Task Manager</li><li>Use 32-bit Task Manager on Windows 2008 or later (standard on 32 bit systems, requires special procedure on 64 bit systems)</li><li>Use the standard 64-bit Task Manager on Windows 2008 or later (least preferred)</li></ol>
<p> <br/><strong><u>Using procdump.exe</u></strong><br/>If the SA console or a DC, analysis, or action module running within it is experiencing access violations or out of memory errors, StealthAUDIT version 6.2.190 or later can run procdump.exe automatically if it's present alongside the StealthAUDIT.exe file. The procdump.exe file should only be present while troubleshooting otherwise spurious dump files can fill up the disk. Copy prodcump.exe to the StealthAUDITV6 folder, then start StealthAUDIT normally. The dump files will be created under the StealthAUDITV6\SADatabase folder, with names such as StealthAudit_131211_121213.dmp, with the numbers corresponding to the date (YMD) and time (HMS) of the dump.<br/> <br/>For hangs, or errors where StealthAUDIT is not automatically producing the dump files, such as an error on startup or shutdown, procdump.exe can create a process dump file immediately when it's run, wait until  or wait until there is an exception and trigger off automatically. To create a dump file immediately, start an administrator command prompt and run:<br/> <br/>                procdump -ma PID<br/> <br/>where PID is the process ID of the process whose memory you want to dump, or:<br/> <br/>                procdump -ma processname<br/> <br/>where processname is the name of the process you want to dump, such as StealthAUDIT.exe.<br/> <br/>To wait for an exception (usually an access violation), you can specify the -e and -f switches (c0000005 is the exception code for access violation):<br/> <br/>                procdump -ma -e 1 -f c0000005 StealthAUDIT<br/> <br/>If the StealthAUDIT process is not yet running, you can specify the -w switch to wait for StealthAUDIT, or the -x switch to start it:<br/> <br/>                procdump -ma -e 1 -f c0000005 -w StealthAUDIT<br/> <br/>Starts procdump waiting StealthAUDIT to start, and waits for an access violation exception before creating a process dump file.<br/> <br/>                procdump -ma -e 1 -f c0000005 -x StealthAUDIT.exe MyJob<br/> <br/>Starts procdump then starts StealthAUDIT and runs MyJob, waiting for an access violation exception before creating a process dump.<br/> <br/><strong><u>Using Task Manager to create a process dump file</u></strong><br/>Windows Vista/2008 and later have the ability to create a process dump file from within Task Manager. However, on 64 bit systems, the default task manager is a 64 bit Task Manager, which creates 64 bit dump files. Since StealthAUDIT is a 32 bit process, it is more difficult to debug with these files than a 32 bit dump file. In order to start 32 bit Task Manager, first close Task Manager. Then go to Start-&gt;Run (or a command prompt) and type C:\Windows\SysWOW64\taskmgr.exe. (Yes, I know it's weird that Windows keeps the 32 bit executables in a directory with a 64 in its name, but I didn't make the decision.) Once you do this, look for taskmgr.exe in the process list. You should see a "*32" next to taskmgr.exe, signifying that it's a 32 bit process:<br/><br/></p></div>
