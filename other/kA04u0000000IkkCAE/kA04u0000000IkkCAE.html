          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Summary:</span></strong> Coming in version
          8.3 of StealthAUDIT will be the ability to collect Box Activity, for the purpose of
          demoing this especially in test environments there is an Activity Generation script that
          can be run to generate some activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong> When demoing the
          StealthAUDIT for Box Activity you're going to want a decent amount of data to demo and
          during a POC it's common that you'll be scanning a test environment which may or may not
          have a sufficient amount of activity. This tool will generate a good amount of activity
          which our DC can go ahead and scan providing a solid data set for StealthAUDIT to report
          on.  <br />This script will take approximately 2 minutes to run and will create and
          subsequently delete everything it has created, all activity that is generated will be done
          by the test user which was created. Everything this script does is described in PowerShell
          while it's running. See screenshots below of entirety of script actions:<br /><img

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you've generated the config.json file follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Grab the powershell script from
            <a
              href="https://downloads.stealthbits.com/access/files/Utilities/Apps/BoxActivityTest.zip"
              target="_blank"
              >https://downloads.stealthbits.com/access/files/Utilities/Apps/BoxActivityTest.zip</a
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            Install the MSI in the zip.  This is a box command line tool, which is a PowerShell
            extension.  Try and leave the default installation path if you can, which is: C:\Program
            Files\BoxCLI\
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Once it's installed you can control box from powershell</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Extract all the files from the zip into their own folder, the main components are a
            PowerShell script (BoxAct.ps1), and a test file (test.txt). You will also need the
            configuration file (config.json file that the customer generates) Copy both the test.txt
            and config.json files into C:\Program Files\BoxCLI\ folder.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The script does the bulk of the work, the test file is just what gets uploaded for
          activity, and the config file describes which box enterprise to operate on.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Once it's installed open up an administrative powershell command shell and enter the
            following command: cd "C:\Program Files\BoxCLI"
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          This command adds the box CLI to the shell Path (so that PowerShell can find it).  If you
          changed the path that the BoxCLI tool was installed to, then change this command to
          reflect the new path.  (This is the only command which requires Admin rights, so after
          this you can theoretically just use a regular powershell command prompt)
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Enter the following command to configure the box CLI tool to know the Box Enterprise.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Command: box configure environments add .\config.json --name CLI<br />After that all that
          remains is to manually edit the BoxAct.ps1 script file to change a few optional settings
          at the top of the file to use the credentials with Box Enterprise admin or co-admin.<br />The
          line looks like this:<br />$BoxUserEmail = "chris.admin@stealthbits.com" #
          "activity.one@stealthbits.com"<br /> <br />edit the account name in the first " "
          section.  (Everything after the # is just a comment)<br />Once that is done, run the test
          script by entering the following into powershell: BoxAct.ps1<br />
