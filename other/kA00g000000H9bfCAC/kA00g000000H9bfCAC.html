        In the client (logon prompt extension) I get the following error after entering username and
        clicking Next
        <img

        />

        <hr />

        When a user enrolls from his machine with help of Password Manager Enrollment, a local copy
        of secret questions-answers pairs is created on the machine. This local questions cache is
        used to reset password in Windows local cache when Password Manager server is not available.
        The error occurs when Logon Prompt Extension is not able to connect to the Password manager
        server and cannot find locally saved questions.

        <hr />

        First of all make sure that client is pointed to the correct Password manager Self-Service
        portal URL. It is determined by the PRM_server registry value located in the following
        registry keys (by priority)
        <ol>
          <li>HKLMSoftware[Wow6432Node]PoliciesNetWrixPassword Manager</li>
          <li>
            HKLMSoftware[Wow6432Node]NetWrixPassword Manager Self-Service client (is used if there
            is no value in the 1st key)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <img
          src="kA00g000000H9bfCAC_bf577b19-e8e4-41e2-99e8-67b33c55dc53.png"
          alt="User-added image"
          width="500"
          height="304"
        />

        If the server URL value is correct, but the server is temporary unavailable, the error is
        expected for users who enrolled via web. If you need an option to reset password in
        disconnected mode, you need to enroll through the Enrollment wizard locally from the
        machine.
