        <p>
          Usually when a StealthAUDIT job runs, there's a single query configuration that's
          applicable to all hosts targeted by that job. That configuration is stored in the Job XML
          in the Jobs folder in the StealthAUDIT installation directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of the advanced, per-host scan configuration capabilities in the File System
          Access Auditor (FSAA) data collector, it's useful to track query configurations on a
          per-host basis. Because it's possible to have table-driven configurations, the query
          configuration for each host is generated at runtime and cannot be stored in the main job
          XML file. Because StealthAUDIT is capable of targeting many hosts at a time and scans are
          typically recurring, it's not practical to store these in individual files over time in
          the job's output directory, either.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, the FSAA data collector stores each host's effective query XML in the
          SA_FSAA_ScanHistory table. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It can be useful to understand how these settings have changed over time (e.g., when new
          sensitive data criteria are added or when file level scanning was enabled). In the
          following example, we look at how to review the Probable Owner configuration over time. 
        </p>
        <pre>SELECT<br/>     ConsoleHost<br/>,    ScanHost<br/>,    JobGUID<br/>,    RunTime<br/>,    SUBSTRING(CONVERT(nvarchar(max),FSAAConfigXML),CHARINDEX('ProbableOwners=',CONVERT(nvarchar(max),FSAAConfigXML),1),18) as ConfigData<br/>FROM SA_FSAA_ScanHistory WHERE ScanType='FSAA' AND ScanHost='<strong>YourTargetHost1</strong>'</pre>
        <p>
          Because the FSAAConfigXML column is an <code>XML</code> data type, you can either search
          is using XPath, or convert to a string and search
          using <code>charindex()</code> and <code>substring()</code>. This example uses the latter
          technique.
        </p>
        <p>That should give you results back that look like the following:<br /><br /></p>
        <div class="table-wrap">
          <table count-columns="5" width="718">
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>ConsoleHost</strong></td>
                <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>ScanHost</strong></td>
                <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>JobGUID</strong></td>
                <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>RunTime</strong></td>
                <td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><strong>ConfigData</strong></td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">SAAPP01</td>
                <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">YourTargetHost1</td>
                <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2d9b30cd-abe7-4cae-add5-32e92011ace6</td>
                <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">2/26/2020 18:28:25.840</td>
                <td colspan="1" rowspan="1">ProbableOwners="0"</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>
        <p>
          <span class="wysiwyg-font-size-small"
            >Note: most of the columns above are intuitive enough, but the JobGUID is actually a way
            to map the job configuration captured in the SA_FSAA_ScanHistory table back to the
            StealthAUDIT Job Tree.</span
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          You can do this for almost any FSAA setting that's visible in the query XML, which is
          embedded in the Job XML as
          <code>JOB.PARTITIONS.PARTITION.TASKS.TASK.FSAA_SETTINGS</code>), as well as other settings
          that are generated at runtime from other input, like sensitive data criteria in global
          settings or a database table being used to define host-specific settings, like shares to
          target. You simply need to update the pattern being searched for in the <code
            >charindex()</code
          >
          function and the number of characters you wish to return with the
          <code>substring()</code> function once the pattern is found.
