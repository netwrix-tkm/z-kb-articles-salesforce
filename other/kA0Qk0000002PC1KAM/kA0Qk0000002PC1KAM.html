<p>If you're using <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Long_Name variable">Netwrix PolicyPak</span> Browser Router -OR- you're using <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">PolicyPak</span> File Associations Manager to make associations, you CANNOT also use the Group Policy or MDM method for setting default associations files, like what's seen here.</p>

<p>Underneath the hood, you are "fighting" with <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">PolicyPak</span> Browser Router and/or File Associations manager, like this.</p>
<p class="img-inside-p"><img alt="This image is not available because: You don’t have the privileges to see it, or it has been removed from the system" src="/img/rte_broken_image.png"/></p>
<p>For <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">PolicyPak</span> Browser Router, <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">PolicyPak</span> Browser Router must "become" the default OS browser like what's seen here. If <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">PolicyPak</span> Browser Router is not set as the Default Browser (automatically, using <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">PolicyPak</span> …) then you will get unusual behavior.</p>
<p class="img-inside-p"><img alt="This image is not available because: You don’t have the privileges to see it, or it has been removed from the system" src="/img/rte_broken_image.png"/></p>
<p>For <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">PolicyPak</span> File Associations Manager, you must remove any Group Policy File Associations file for it to work reliably.<br/>Summary: Use only <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">PolicyPak</span> … when using <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">PolicyPak</span> Browser Router and also <span class="mc-variable PolicyPak.Product_Short_Name variable">PolicyPak</span> File Associations Manager and don't try to use a Group Policy or MDM File Associations alongside it.</p>
