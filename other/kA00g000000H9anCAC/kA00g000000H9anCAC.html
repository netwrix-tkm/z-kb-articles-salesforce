        A user receives a Session expired message when trying to reset their password using the
        Self-Service portal.

        <hr />

        Password Manager is based on IIS and uses internal IIS session variables to handle info. IIS
        session is limited and may expire. Default timeout is 20 minutes. Such error can also occur
        when there are issues with cookies, for example they do not correspond to the current
        session, or refer to another URL, etc.

        <hr />

        First of all, make sure that it is not a real session expiration. If a user started the
        password reset procedure more that 20 minutess ago, then this is an expected message. Also
        please try clearing up all cookies. If this does not help, check if there is an incorrect
        redirection in IIS. Please refer to the
        <a href="https://kb.netwrix.com/823" target="_blank">KB823</a> for instructions on how to
        set up redirection for Password Manager.
