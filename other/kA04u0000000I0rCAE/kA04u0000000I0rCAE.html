        <p><strong>Before Fix:</strong></p>
        <p>
          When running FSAA SDD scans, the FSAA scanners would allocate a certain amount of memory
          per scanner to scan the file. The amount allocated was based on a variety of factors (file
          type, file size, available RAM, etc.). In a situation where the allocated heap size was
          exceeded for a particular file, a broken pipe error would occur which had downward effects
          on the rest of the scan, resulting in incomplete/failed SDD scans.
        </p>
        <p><strong>After Fix:</strong></p>
        <p>
          The allocated memory per scanner is now configurable thru the job xml. By default, SDD
          scans will have a max heap size of 1500 MB per scanner. If the amount of memory required
          to scan a particular file exceeds this amount, a broken pipe error will still occur.
          However, this will no longer have any downward effects on the rest of the scan. The rest
          of the scan should proceed as normal, and the broken pipe error will be limited to that
          file. <br /><br />To scan files that require more memory, you can modify the Max Heap Size
          in the Job XML:<br /><br /><img

            alt="mceclip0.png"
          /><br /><br />Please note that this value is in MB and it applies on a per scanner basis.
