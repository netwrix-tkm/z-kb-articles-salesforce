          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Summary:</span></strong> Error 403 implies
          that access to a web-application is being denied, despite having the proper permissions.
          This can happen when the claims on a web-app or site collection are mis-configured or
          otherwise not supported by SPAA.

            Typically Error 403 implies that SharePoint is being blocked by IE, check this by trying
            to log into SharePoint on from the server StealthAUDIT is on through the browser. If

            something similar to the screenshot below then there is a misconfiguration with the

              Provider" can be configured to support both integrated windows and forms based
              authentication simultaneously.  In this kind of scenario, SharePoint displays this
              screen to allow the user to select which authentication method to use. (If it were
              configured for both we would see options Windows Authentication and Active Directory
              or SQL credentials for example)

            far as the web.config file is concerned which indicates the misconfiguration is
            elsewhere. The easiest way to reset configuration for the authentication provider is to
            use the SharePoint admin console to edit the config to something else, and then set it
            back to what it should be.  We did this as follows:</span

            >On the previous screen shot, we clicked the dropdown box under "Integrated Windows
            Authentication" (where it shows "Negotiate (Kerberos)") and set it to anything else
            (typically the only other choice is NTLM), and then click SAVE at the bottom of the
            dialog, and then set the dropdown box back to what it was originally set to, and click
            SAVE again.  Note: Track the initial setting the customer has, and make sure it ends up
            reset to the same setting.</span

            should only see one option displayed for credentials. Scans should now be able to
