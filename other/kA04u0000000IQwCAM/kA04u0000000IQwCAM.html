This is typically caused by blank or corrupted job XML files.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong> When a customer reaches out stating that their job tree is missing from the console or only partially loading it is typically caused by a blank or corrupted Job XML file somewhere in the job tree. These blank or corrupted XML files are typically caused by a forced reboot of the server during a job execution, or when disk space for the drive hosting the StealthAUDIT application is depleted. <br/>Emails describing this issue will typically come in during Patch Cycles. The XML files are blank most times because during a scheduled task execution the XML file is held open until the job finishes at which time it is saved. If the server is forcibly rebooted then the XML doesn't get a chance to properly save.</p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Instructions:</span></strong> The easiest way to resolve this issue is to get on a call with the customer and find the job with the corrupted XML and restore it to the working state. Step to find the corrupted XML are as follows.<br/>Â </p>
