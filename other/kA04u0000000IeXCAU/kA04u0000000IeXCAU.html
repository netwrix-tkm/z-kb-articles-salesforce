          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Summary:</span></strong> Administrator has
          deleted a disabled user's folders from a share on a file server, however when accessing
          the share resource from the AIC, those folder are still visible even after a full rescan
          and bulk import. FSAA scan job and bulk import shows no errors. Running below hotfixes did
          not help resolve, either.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong> In this case even
          though the customer deleted a disabled users folder, there was still a duplicate folder of
          the same object name that was "hidden" in the same root directory on the share. It was
          hidden in the fact that instead of displaying the correct folder name in CIFS, it showed
          as a folder called "Documents".  When we right clicked&gt;Properties and went to the
          security tab we could see that the "Object Name" was in fact named the same as the
          original folder structure. So, AIC was able to pick up on this and correctly display it as
          such.<br /> <br /> 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Instructions:</span></strong> A good way to
          see if CIFS is actually reporting the correct name of the folders displayed as either
          "Documents" or "public Documents" is to bring up file explorer in Windows and go to the
          share that contains those folders, choose another column header by right clicking on the
          columns and choosing .More, then locate and select the Filename attribute. Once you do
          this you will now see the true name of the folder. Issue seems to stem from something that
          Microsoft is doing or something that is CIFS related. In any case, it doesn't appear that
          StealthAUDIT is to blame.<br /> <br /><img
