        <p><strong>KB Type: </strong>Bug</p>
        <p><strong>Issue:</strong></p>
        <p>
          When more than 2 domains are targeted in the AD action module "Access Denied" error
          received
        </p>
        <p>
          This HF does not directly fix the issue, this fixes a bug where impersonations weren't
          being rolled back after being used
        </p>
        <p><strong>Root cause of Issue:</strong></p>
        <p>
          To mark a Credential as good to use, we impersonate as that Credential and then attempt to
          connect to LDAP:///RootDSE and make a read from that. If we can perform that read
          successfully, the Credential is deemed good. There could be an issue with their
          Credentials where they can perform a read off RootDSE but are unable to go deeper with
          those Credentials, causing a false positive.  
        </p>
