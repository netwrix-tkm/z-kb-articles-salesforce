                  reasonably be exploited:<br />1. The malicious actor would already need to be
                  active within their network. <br />2. That actor would have to be aware of our Web
                  Application. <br /><br />If those preconditions are met, this malicious actor
                  could potentially use a DoS attack to take down our web application. However, none
                  of the threats listed result in any data being exposed or provide the attacker
                  with the ability to execute code. Consequently, both the possibility and potential
                  impact of this vulnerability are minimal.
