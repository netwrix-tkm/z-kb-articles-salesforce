<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong> sometimes customers split / duplicate out their collection jobs for multiple regions, or sets of hosts, proxies, etc.  </p>
<p>The upgrade wizard in 8.2 onwards handles this issue, however in some cases this may still need to be carried out.<br/><br/>a standard upgrade where that hasn't been done, would normally involve</p>
<ol><li>noting the settings from the collection jobs</li><li>removing the solution, and adding the new one</li><li>re-configuring the collection settings on the new one</li></ol>
<p>However, if there are a lot of collection jobs, that becomes a big hassle, and allows for too much human error.  <br/>Here's how to get around it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Instructions:</span></strong></p>
<div>The main points here are:</div>
<div>1) the FSAA queries should work after upgrade<br/>2) the bulk import data analysis tasks need to be updated<br/>3) the reporting jobs need to be updated.  </div>
<p><br/><strong>Here's a rough set of instructions:</strong><br/><br/>0) backup the solution set or entire job tree, just in case.  <br/><span>If it's taking a while, you're backing up job logs (JobName_Log.tsv) log files that could be deleted.</span><br/><br/>1) move the collection jobs to the side, outside of the file system set<br/>2) delete the rest of the filesystem solution through the SA interface so that the published reports and old group descriptions are cleared out<br/>3) add the new FileSystem solution from the instant job library<br/>4) move the 0.colleciton group to the side, outside of the file system solution, as well.  <br/>5) put the split out collection jobs back into the filsystem solution, if you want.  </p>
<div>leaving them in a separate group like "FileSystem Collections" might make future upgrades easier, but either way is fine.  </div>
<p>6) remove all DataAnalysisTasks.XML files from the scan and bulk import jobs.  </p>
<div>the bulk imports are really the important part.  they create the functions and views for the FSAA schema, which need to match core / dc versions.  <br/>the scan job's Data Analysis Tasks just drop data if you enable them.  so, they don't really matter, but we shouldn't leave them out of date, either.  <br/>so, to keep things simple, delete them all.  you can do this easily through windows explorer, and refresh the job tree.  <br/>SA will create blank DataAnalysisTasks.XML files for the jobs once you refresh the tree.</div>
<p>7) from here you have two options because the Bulk Import Analysis Tasks only need to be run once.  </p>
<div>1) create a new group that will be a centralized area for housing the new Data Analysis tasks. </div>
<div>create a new job for each type of bulk import and copy the new DataAnalysisTasks.xml files into them through windows explorer<br/>refresh the job tree?</div>
<div>2) update the new bulk import jobs with the new DataAnalysisTasks.xml files using windows explorer &amp; refresh the job tree.  </div>
<div> </div>
