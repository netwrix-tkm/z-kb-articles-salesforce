          StealthAUDIT for Active Directory solution’s WeakPasswords job can reveal a lot of
          exceptions about an Active Directory environment that are important. One of those
          exceptions is the Historical Weak Password.

          By default, Active Directory retains a user’s previous passwords to prevent them from
          being reused, if configured to do so. This is a configurable value within Group Policy,
          and it is recommended to keep the maximum configurable value of 24. StealthAUDIT is able
          to analyze user’s previous passwords stored in Active Directory the same way it can
          analyze the current password to determine if it is weak. Just like the current passwords,
          the hashes of the historical passwords are compared against the dictionary file leveraged
          by the job to determine if they were found in a breached password dictionary file. If a
          user is identified as having a Weak Historical Password, that can indicate a trend that
          the user is using commonly used passwords (e.g. Winter2021) or passwords that they share
          among other accounts that may have been breached. The exception by itself is not an
          indicator of exposure to a password spraying or brute force attack. If a user is to be
          found leveraging a Weak Historical password and a current Weak Password, they may be a
          good candidate for education on password hygiene and a forced reset. It is Stealthbits
          recommendation that users that have Weak Historical Passwords should be monitored for
          continued use of breached passwords to prevent future exposure.
