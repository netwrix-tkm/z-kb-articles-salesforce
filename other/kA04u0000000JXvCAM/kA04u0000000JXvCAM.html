I thought I would post it here for your information as I have to admit, its a bit of a black hole <img class="emoticon emoticon-smile" alt="(smile)" height="16" src="kA04u0000000JXvCAM_b931d48e-43df-4734-b16d-26481749ef58.png" width="16"/></p>

<p>This process was created by James and has been presented to the sales team and so they should be following these steps. Note, the second step on the second row, I believe this was not happening before. Log Tracker temp licenses were going elsewhere but as of now, 21st Feb 2018, they will be coming to support and so it is our responsibility to edit and pass onto the customer.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>With reference to the step:</p>

<p>Support dude edits the auth.txt file content removing Correlog references</p>

<p>The change which needs to be made to the file is simply the replacement of Correlog with nntws.</p>

<p>The file is received by NNT from Correlog in this format.</p>

<p>Edit, replacing the word Correlog with nntws, before sending to the customer.</p>
