They will only be go back and scan older log files if the filters are changed on a subsequent scan and the activity wasn't picked up. So for example if you have 10 days of logs and initial scan filters are set to 5 for ActivityEvents and 10 for Daily Activity, and then on subsequent scan the filters are changed to 10 and 10, FSAC will go back and re-parse the 5 days of logs that didn't collect ActivityEvents previously. In this scenario, daily activity will not be re-collected. <br/><br/>This implementation can cause ActivityEvents table to show ActivityEvents out of date order. So using the above example if the initially only scanned back 5 days and then on the subsequent scan changed it to 10 days, the subsequent scan data will appear after the initial scan data. Due to this implementation we had to change the way we delete old activity events. The old way was to delete by ActivityID, but now we need to delete by date, since the dates could be out of order.</p><p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Instructions:</span></strong> </p><ol><li><strong><span>Drop included modules into the DC folder onto your SA console, and into the Proxy install directory on any machines that are running the proxy server.
