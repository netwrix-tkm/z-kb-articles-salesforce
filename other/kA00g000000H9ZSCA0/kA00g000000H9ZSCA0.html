        The error indicates that their password cannot be reset due to the Domain Password Policy
        limiting Minimum password age. With the current product architecture, a users password is
        not reset directly, but it is actually a two-step procedure The password is first reset to a
        random value, and then a regular password change on behalf of a user is performed. This is
        done to apply a password policy to the new password, otherwise, it could be possible to set
        any password. By design, a user cannot reset their password more often than they are allowed
        to change it by the policy. However, it is possible to bypass this by making Password
        Manager ignore Minimum length, Minimum password age and Password history policies. To do
        this go to the Password Manager Administrative portal, Navigate to
        <strong>Domains - Edit</strong> corresponding domain<br /><img
