          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Summary:</span></strong> Client wanted to
          force DFS scanning to target servers in a specific geographic location, however
          StealthAUDIT often just grabs any available target path. This workflow allows SA to query
          customer environment for available target paths for a DFS share, and then overwrite our
          standard query's targets.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong> DFS Folder targets
          are picked indiscriminately, with no recourse for a user to override those targets. 
          Examples include a target preference or a geographic preference by client.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Instructions:</span></strong> Out of the
          box, SA will query a DC for name spaces, folder targets, and paths for any given DFS
          setup.  It will then pick one target indiscriminately amongst available target paths for a
          folder.  However, there may be situations where a customer may wish to use a specific
          path, one that SA did not choose.  (Similar to the way a customer may elect for a
          different DC than what the Dynamic Host List 'Default Domain Controller' chose.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <br />We'll use a single Namespace here, with two folders:<br /><img
            src="kA04u0000000IK8CAM_c0ad08a2-d945-486b-be23-ae30f987e4dc.png"
            alt="mceclip0.png"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          The two folders have multiple targets with full replication set up between them.  (This PS
          query will be turned into a job later.)<br /><img
            src="kA04u0000000IK8CAM_a82d84c7-b5c6-4d23-93dd-595e2d475dab.png"
            alt="mceclip1.png"
          /><br /> <br />Without modification, here is the result within SA after running the
          "0-FSDFS System Scans" job:<br />Two of the three hosts made it to the DFS Host List:<br /><img
            src="kA04u0000000IK8CAM_6ed56225-b966-4d29-b0b5-874d44c2015e.png"
            alt="mceclip2.png"
          /><br /> <br />If we query the
          <span
            ><span><span>[SA_FSDFS_Links]</span></span></span
          ><span
            ><span
              ><span>
                table we can see some details of which paths were picked (some columns omitted for
                space):</span
              ></span
            ></span
          ><br /><img
            src="kA04u0000000IK8CAM_b84b1ed1-3d61-4422-bfff-cb52fd7bc190.png"
            alt="mceclip3.png"
          /><br /> <br />But take a look at the results of the PS query again.  Notice in the
          <em>ReferralPriorityClass</em> column that one of the targets for \DFSFolder has a value
          of <em>global-high</em>.  This is due to a DFS configuration option available to admins
          that is not considered in our current target selection:<br /><img
            src="kA04u0000000IK8CAM_b5ff79ad-6770-4bef-ad52-01467d630823.png"
            alt="mceclip4.png"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          The host TATOOINE is not set to be scanned at all, as evident by its absence in our DFS
          host list.<br /> <br /><strong
            >In order to override these targets, we will use PS to query all DFS folder target paths
            into a table, and then insert them into the appropriate SA tables before the host lists
            are created.</strong
          ><br /> <br />The first step is to create a job that will query and create our table of
          possible targets.  1 query, No analysis or actions.  Name something sensible, as you will
          reference the _DEFAULT table later.   Create a new query with the POWERSHELL data
          collector, default settings for all config pages should be fine.  Use the following for
          the query:<br /><span>$roots=Get-DfsnRoot | Select-Object -ExpandProperty path</span
          ><br /><span>foreach ($root in $roots){</span><br /><span
            >Get-DfsnFolder -Path ($root+"\*") | Get-DfsnFolderTarget</span
          ><br /><span>}</span><br /> <br />Be sure to set a host, in most cases local host will
          work fine.  The results should be the same as above:<br /><img
            src="kA04u0000000IK8CAM_d174bec0-4888-4125-a9d6-3473e72f1dc0.png"
            alt="mceclip5.png"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, create a new analysis inside of the "0-DFS System Scan" job.  Name it something that
          will catch the eye of future engineers as being custom work in an out-of-the-box solution
          if possible.  You must bring the new analysis to the top of the list; it
          <strong>must</strong> run before the other two:<br /><img
            src="kA04u0000000IK8CAM_ba759c43-3ac9-492e-97c2-12a0b88c1212.png"
            alt="mceclip6.png"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          The analysis should be a simple update statement to the DF<br /><span
            >UPDATE [dbo].[SA_FSDFS_Links]</span
          ><br /><span>SET [TargetPath] = o.[TargetPath]</span><br /><span
            >FROM [dbo].[SA_FSDFS_Links] d</span
          ><br /><span>LEFT JOIN [dbo].[SA_DFS_Override_DEFAULT] o</span><br /><span
            >ON LOWER(d.[DfsPath]) = LOWER(o.[Path])</span
          ><br /><span>AND/WHERE . . . </span><br /> <br /><strong
            ><em
              ><span
                >Here is where you must consider your customer's needs to complete the query.  Maybe
                the want to target the priority targets, maybe they want to avoid them.  Maybe they
                do not have priorities set at all but still want all scans on a specific Geographic
                location.  This, as well as the path names themselves will shape the rest of the
                query.</span
              ></em
            ></strong
          ><br />You will also need to update the [TargetHostId] column with the correct ID for
          changes made.  These IDS can be found on the
          <span
            ><span><span>[SA_FSAA_Hosts]</span></span></span
          >
          table.  (If you are looking to include a host that is not currently there, it will need to
          be added.  A quick zero-level scan will add it as well as test connection/permissions.) 
          The following query should update any changes, but always double check:<br /><span
            >UPDATE [dbo].[SA_FSDFS_Links]</span
          ><br /><span>SET [TargetHostID] = h.[ID]</span><br /><span
            >FROM [dbo].[SA_FSDFS_Links] d</span
          ><br /><span>LEFT JOIN [dbo].[SA_FSAA_Hosts] h</span><br /><span
            >ON h.[HOST] = SUBSTRING(d.[TargetPath],3,CHARINDEX('\',d.[TargetPath],3)-3)</span
          ><br /><span
            >WHERE [TargetHostID] <br /> <br />In our example, I am looking for a single change
            where I have a global preference set.  I have also chosen to surface the
            [SA_FSDFS_Links] table here so that I can more easily reference the results:<br /><img
              src="kA04u0000000IK8CAM_f6bff4e7-e80c-442c-bd12-0fd711ba030c.png"
              alt="mceclip7.png"
          /></span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Running the "0-DFS System Scan" job again, we can then see our results:<br /><img
            src="kA04u0000000IK8CAM_d5f00028-38ad-4964-a711-e5a1db860401.png"
            alt="mceclip8.png"
          />
        </p>
        <p>
          The 'DFSFolder' target now reflects the change, as does the host ID.  Our DFS Host list
          now contains 3 hosts, and when a scan is initiated against the host list it will scan
          TATOOINE instead of CORUSCANT as it would have previously:<br /><img
            src="kA04u0000000IK8CAM_5b91b68f-ec86-4b89-8d6b-a35133425876.png"
            alt="mceclip9.png"
          /><br /> <br />As an alternate example, HOTH is a geographic location known for ice storms
          that lead to poor network connectivity.  If the customer wished to avoid scanning HOTH,
          and it is known that all DFS targets on HOTH are always replicated to TATOOINE, we may
          craft our SQL statement differently:<br /><img
            src="kA04u0000000IK8CAM_8f6a9fe6-c5bf-4ce1-b7d4-a1806a4562ea.png"
            alt="mceclip10.png"
          /><br /> <br />This will lead to a result as such:<br /><img
            src="kA04u0000000IK8CAM_2573e326-167e-4724-9a66-484e55192f33.png"
            alt="mceclip11.png"
          />
        </p>
        <p>And HOTH will be ignored for any DFS scoped scans.<br /><br /></p>
