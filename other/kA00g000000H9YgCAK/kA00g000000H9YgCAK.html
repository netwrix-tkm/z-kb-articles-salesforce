          An enrollment wizard pops up every time a user logs in. After completing the wizard, a
          message appears confirming that the enrollment procedure has been successful. However, on
          next login, the wizard pops up again.
        </div>
        <div>
          In the Password Manager administrative console, the user appears as not enrolled into the
          system.
        </div>

        <hr />

        Such behavior occurs because of authentication issues. Enrollment wizard uses Windows
        authentication to pass crednetials of a user to Password Manager server. The authentication
        can be configured incorrectly, and because of it another user gets enrolled instead of the
        correct user.

        If you are using single server instalaltion, make sure that the
        <strong>gina_set_answers.asp </strong>and
        <strong>gina_set_answers_anonymous.asp </strong>files are configured to use
        Windows-integrated authentication in the IIS.
