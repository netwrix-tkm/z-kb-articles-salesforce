Netwrix Auditor relies on Windows Event logs to collect information about logons.<br/>Information about a single logon is spread into 3 or more event records which often times don't go one after another and can have a very large temporal spread. Sometimes, Non-Interactive logons can be recorded in Netwrix Auditor as interactive ones, due to similarities of Event Log recordings in both scenarios where interactive or non-interactive logons are recorded. In this case, we recommend looking at the properties of an account making a logon to see whether it has permission at all to logon interactively</div>
