<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong> STEALTHbits File Activity Monitor may be collecting old and/or out of order activity events from an Isilon server.  <br/><br/>Isilon logs are not streamed directly to the CEE server like events from NetApp filers are sent to FPolicy servers in real-time. Instead, the events are cached locally on the Isilon and then published to the CEE server. You may encounter this if there is an extended loss of connection between the Isilon and the CEE server, or if one of the Isilon nodes comes online after having gone offline before "catching up" to live events.<br/> </p>
<p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Instructions:</span></strong> <span><span><strong>Prior to proceeding with the following instructions, please note this is an issue with the Isilon device, and is not a STEALTHbits software issue. It should, therefore, be the customer's responsibility to fix or maintain this functionality.  </strong></span></span><br/><br/><br/>To address, you can</p>
<ul><li>Wait for the logs to catch up - this may take hours or weeks to occur, and is proportional to the number of events in the local cache on the Isilon.</li><li>Reset the cache "pointer" on the Isilon so that it skips over the events in the cache</li><li>Flush the cache by deleting or moving the existing logs and start fresh. (Steps described below).</li></ul>
<p> <br/><strong><u>Steps to clear the CELOG</u></strong><br/>This procedure is for clusters running OneFS 8.x.<br/><br/>1. Open an SSH connection to any node in the cluster using the root account.<br/><br/>2. If you want to preserve the original files, make a copy of all files listed in Step 4 before proceeding.<br/><br/>3. Disable the CELOG service and make sure that you see that this was done:<br/>Cluster-1<strong># isi services -a celog disable</strong><br/>The service 'celog' has been disabled.<br/><br/>Check that the CELOG process no longer runs on any node.<br/>Do not issue the disable command multiple times. Please wait for 30-60 seconds and check again that the processes have stopped.<br/>The output below indicates no CELOG process is running:<br/>Cluster-1<strong># isi_for_array -s "ps -auwx | grep '[c]elog'"</strong><br/>Cluster-1 exited with status 1<br/>Cluster-2 exited with status 1<br/>Cluster-3 exited with status 1<br/><br/>4. Delete the CELOG database files:<br/><strong># rm -rf /ifs/.ifsvar/db/celog<br/># rm -rf /ifs/.ifsvar/db/celog_capture<br/># rm -rf /ifs/.ifsvar/db/celog_analysis<br/># rm -rf /ifs/.ifsvar/db/celog_reporting<br/># rm -rf /ifs/.ifsvar/db/celog_alerting<br/># isi_for_array rm -rf /var/db/celog_capture</strong><br/><br/>5. Enable the CELOG service and make sure that you see that this was done:<br/>Cluster-1<strong># isi services -a celog enable</strong><br/>The service 'celog' has been enabled.<br/><br/>Check that CELOG processes are running on each node. Using the "wc -l" command will count the processes on each node and can be used to quickly check that all nodes have processes running in large clusters. Do not issue the "enable" command multiple times. Wait and check the process status after 30-60 seconds, to give the service a chance to start. For large clusters, wait up to 5 minutes. If CELOG does not start, contact Dell EMC Technical Support.<br/>Cluster-1<strong># isi_for_array -s "ps -auwx | grep '[c]elog' "</strong><br/>Cluster-1<strong># isi_for_array -s "ps -auwx | grep '[c]elog' | wc -l "</strong><br/><br/>See, the Notes section below for an example of a healthy CELOG service on a 3-node cluster.<br/><br/>6. Send a test event to verify that CELOG is working properly:<br/><strong># isi event test create "TestCELOG"</strong><br/><br/>This will generate a test event that will be listed in the output of the "isi event events list" command:<br/>1.267 10/14 07:47 W    1    1027           TestCELOG<br/><br/>Wait 1-2 minutes to verify that the event is listed. If the event is not shown, try again in 2 minutes.<br/> </p>
