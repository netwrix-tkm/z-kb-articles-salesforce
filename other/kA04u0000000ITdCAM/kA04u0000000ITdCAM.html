Issue: When making membership changes through the Change Access wizard, the changes are normally committed in the Commit page, but the 'Previous' button was still enabled allowing the user to go back and forth in the wizard, this action caused emails to be sent to the modified member every time the next button was hit.
Fix: 
-	The 'Previous' button is now disabled in the 'Commit' page, so the user can't go back in the wizard at this point.
-	Also, in the 'Add Notes' pages the text "Click next to commit your changes" was added, to inform that the changes will take effect after hitting the 'Next' button.</p><p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong> Modules Included <br/>- AccessInformationCenter.msi 7.1.60.54 <br/><br/>YouTrack/Escalations <br/>- SMPC-1516/ Escalations 10443: E-mail notification and user being assigned to resource is being completed before changes in wizard are finalized. <br/><br/>Customers <br/>- Banner Bank <br/><br/>Cumulative List of fixes included since Service Pack: <br/>- Adjust certificate signing script <br/>- Query parses GUID instead of detecting SID in local group membership <br/>- Do not disable certificate validation by default <br/>- SMPC-1217: 9207 - AIC domain user login issue <br/>- SMPC-1292: 9604 - Enhancement - AIC domain enumeration whitespace <br/>- Use node Text for account when necessary <br/>- SMPC-755: Error when attempting to export a large number of rows (292,104) <br/>- Fixed filtering for custom columns <br/>- Fixed denied rights visibility in permissions reports <br/>- Alerts notification - reordering data shown by most recent date for unusual activity <br/>- Fixed change modeling display bugs - membership additions of more than 2 members wouldn't show in group explorer <br/>- SMPC-1516: 10443 - E-mail notification and user being assigned to resource is being completed before changes in wizard are finalized.</p><p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Instructions:</span></strong> <a href="http://downloads.stealthbits.com/access/files/SAHotFixes/7.1/AIC_7.1_SP1_004.zip" target="_blank">http://downloads.stealthbits.com/access/files/SAHotFixes/7.1/AIC_7.1_SP1_004.zip</a>
