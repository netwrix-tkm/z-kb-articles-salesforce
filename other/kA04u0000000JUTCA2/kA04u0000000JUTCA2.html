This way, as change activity is forecast and scheduled, the actual resulting changes can be reconciled in a <a class="external-link" href="https://www.newnettechnologies.com/servicenow.html" target="_blank">closed-loop change control process</a>.</li><li><strong><em>Focus:</em></strong> Real-time detection operated with file reputation and other threat intelligence analysis enables an automated categorization of changes. This not only suppresses ‘change noise’ (everyday changes to systems such as scheduled patching must still be reported and is a major weakness of 1<sup>st</sup> generation FIM tools), but better still serves to prioritize focus on the remaining minority of unplanned, unexpected changes. Change noise has a lot to answer for and needs to be eliminated to give a clear picture of ‘Are we under attack?’</li><li><strong><em>Automation:</em></strong> With Planned Changes correlated with Change Requests and change noise filtered out, this leaves unplanned changes to be managed via the ITSM Incident workflow. Incidents can be created automatically and augmented with context such as who made the change. The vision for ITSM leaders such as ServiceNow is that security incidents are presented with all available security intelligence collated automatically in order to shortcut the investigation and remediation processes.</li></ol><p>With Mean time to Detection for security breaches still averaging 190 days, the SecureOps approach offers a means to revolutionize the effectiveness of security controls for any organization, reducing times to detection and for remediation. It offers a way to operate IT Services which are more secure, more of the time.</p><p>For too long in the IT Security world, the industry has promised change but things have stayed the same. New products and technologies have still resulted in an inexorable increase in reported breaches. SecureOps allows us to break the cycle: IT systems can be changed, improved and updated as much as needed while the thing that really matters, the integrity of our secure systems, can be kept the same.</p></div>
