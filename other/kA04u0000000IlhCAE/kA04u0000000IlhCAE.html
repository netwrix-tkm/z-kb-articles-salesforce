          <strong>Summary:</strong> 1. ManagedAccount is not enabled when CreateAccount is FALSE
          Managed accounts are not getting enabled when the activity starts if the "Create Account"
          flag for the Activity is set to false. This causes logins to fail for managed accounts if
          users attempt to logon to the target resource. The fix will enable the account during the
          pre-session stage regardless if SbPAM will create the managed account. 2. Disconnected
          users don't get logged off at end of session When users connect to a target resource
          during an activity they are not logged off automatically by SbPAM at the end of their
          activity session if they disconnect from the RDP session by closing the RDP client. Users
          that keep their RDP sessions open until the end of the session will be logged off. The fix
          will force a logoff for RDP sessions in the disconnected state as well as active state
          when the activity session ends. The "Logoff User" step is also added to all default
          activities.
