          As a software publisher, Netwrix takes its responsibility to provide you secure software
          products seriously. Before installing software that you've obtained from the internet, you
          should verify its authenticity (that you obtained it from an authorized source) and its
          integrity (that it hasn't been modified). Netwrix employs multiple techniques to enable
          you to verify the authenticity and integrity of the software we publish.

          Netwrix uses industry-standard code signing technologies to provide evidence of the
          authenticity and integrity of the software we publish. The following certificates are
          used:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Windows binaries are signed with a code signing certificate issued to "Netwrix
            Corporation" with extended validation by Digicert. The certificate fingerprint is
            <code>80E18E3389CE740D3F124CC45D5CF83A55FD472A</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Linux and UNIX packages (RPM, deb, etc.) are signed with the "Netwrix Corporation (PGP
            Signing Key) &lt;productsecurity@netwrix.com&gt;" PGP key. The public key fingerprint
            is <code>3F5EB22771A2BD66D1AA011A43E7B9B0AE7B49D8</code> and can be obtained at <a

          In addition to signing our releases, Netwrix publishes cryptographic hashes for each
          download. A file containing the hash can be downloaded from the Customer Portal by

          /> icon next to each download. To protect from unauthorized modification, these files are
          signed with the "Netwrix Corporation (PGP Signing Key)
          &lt;productsecurity@netwrix.com&gt;" PGP key. The public key fingerprint
