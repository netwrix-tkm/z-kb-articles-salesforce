          <strong>Summary:</strong> You have a need to update your STEALTHbits web reports and
          Access Information Console (AIC) to utilize SSL to secure the connections to those
          websites using HTTPS, while at the same time enabling single sign-on (SSO) and being able
          to access the AIC from the web reports console.
        </p>

        <p>Hotfixes: NA</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Issue:</strong> After a fresh install or an upgrade, the default settings for web
          reports utilizes HTTP on port 8082.
        </p>

        <p>
          Extra steps are required to secure the StealthAUDIT reporting website and the AIC with
          SSL. By default, AIC uses ports 81 for HTTP and 481 for HTTPS, which you will need to
          configure with Windows Server’s built in IIS, by following the instructions detailed
          below.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Instructions:</strong>  After a fresh install or upgrade, the first step in
          securing your web reports and AIC website is to make sure you have a certificate that you
          can use. Typically, companies request a certificate through their certificate authority
          (CA) and import it into the certificate store on the StealthAUDIT console server.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Start with Web Reports</strong></p>

        <p>
          To bind the certificate to the web console (port 8082) run these commands as a System
          Administrator, in a Windows Powershell:
        </p>

        <p><strong>Step1:</strong>  netsh http show sslcert</p>

        <p>
          If this command does not show a certificate bound to port 8082, proceed to the next step.
          Otherwise, you might need to remove the current cert with the command:
        </p>

        <p>netsh http delete sslcert ipport=0.0.0.0:8082</p>

        <p>Alternatively, you can choose an unused port and continue</p>

        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong>  dir cert:\localmachine\my</p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >This command outputs the “thumbprint value” for the certificate, which is needed to run
            the script in the next step</strong
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Step 3:</strong>  $guid = "bdd5710f-7cbe-4f85-b8c1-da4bddf485a8" # This will be
          the same for all installations because it is a GUID from the built-in webserver
          application
        </p>

        <p>$certHash = "INSERT THUMBNAIL VALUE FROM STEP 2 BETWEEN QUOTES"</p>

        <p>$ip = "0.0.0.0" # this means all IP addresses</p>

        <p>$port = "8082" # the default HTTPS port</p>

        <p>"http add sslcert ipport=$($ip):$port certhash=$certHash appid={$guid}" | netsh</p>

        <p>
          <strong
            >This example script binds the certificate to port 8082, the default setting.</strong
          >
        </p>

        <p> * Remember to change the $certHash value from step 2, prior to running the script.</p>

        <p>
          <strong> Step 4:  </strong>A successful binding displays the message “SSL Certificate
          successfully added” shown below:
        </p>

        <p>
           <img
            alt="mceclip0.png"
            src="kA04u0000000IK2CAM_32b4f24f-8ac6-43c4-91ca-8876166c6950.png"
          />
        </p>

        <p>
           * The $guid is subject to change. As a result, this KB might be updated as the product is
          updated.
        </p>

        <p>
           Once the port is bound, the next step is to configure the WebServer.exe.config file. To
          do this:
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Step 1:</strong> In File Explorer, navigate to the directory %sainstalldir%\web\
          and open the file, Webserver.exe.config (Your account needs read/write privileges to
          modify this file)
        </p>

        <p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Edit the Binding URL setting by changing:</p>

        <p>
          http://+:8082"/&gt;  and changing the value to "<a href="https://+:8082" target="_blank"
            >http<strong>s</strong>://+:8082</a
          >"/&gt;”
        </p>

        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong>  Edit the WindowsAuthentication setting by changing:</p>

        <p>and changing the value to “True”</p>

        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>  Edit the AdditionalContentTabs by changing:</p>

        <p>
          and changing the value to “Access,
          <a href="https://+:481/v2/login?embed" target="_blank">https://+:481/v2/login?embed</a>”
        </p>

        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Save the file and continue</p>

        <p>
          Next, you need to update the URL in the Reports section of the Global Settings within the
          SA console shown below:
        </p>

        <p>
          <img
            alt="mceclip0.png"
            src="kA04u0000000IK2CAM_8ecca01a-cd8d-4510-8aa8-36c4be17e775.png"
          />
        </p>

        <p>To change these settings:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Open StealthAUDIT and navigate to the Reporting node, found under Settings</li>
          <li>Modify the Website URL from “http” to “https”</li>
          <li>Save the setting</li>
          <li>Navigate to the desktop shortcut “Published Reports”</li>
          <li>Edit the properties by right-clicking and selecting “Properties”</li>
          <li>Change the URL from “http” to “https”</li>
          <li>Click “Apply” to save the setting</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          <img
            alt="mceclip1.png"
            src="kA04u0000000IK2CAM_ce9e0ae5-6911-4a4d-8207-3aea6458a5d9.png"
          />
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Launch the ‘Services’ app by clicking the Start button and searching for ‘Services’
          </li>
          <li>Right Click the item “StealthAUDIT Web Server” and select Restart</li>
          <li>
            Confirm that you can access the web reports by opening the Published Reports shortcut
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
           <strong>Troubleshooting:</strong>  If your organization does not have a process for
          certificate requests, and the desire is to use a self-signed certificate, you can use the
          ‘New-SelfSignedCertificate’ commandlet, in the Administrator PowerShell version 3.0+ to
          generate and import the certificate by:
        </p>

        <p>
          Step 1:  Running the command and replacing your DnsName with the appropriate machine and
          domain
        </p>

        <p class="wysiwyg-indent4">
          New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName machinename.domain.com -CertStoreLocation Cert:\LocalMachine\My
        </p>

        <p>
          Step 2:  The output provides a Thumbprint Value, that is the certificate Hash value to be
          used when binding to the port. The port can be the same as in HTTP (8082). Use this Hash
          value for Step 2 of the Enable SSL for the Web Console instructions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Step 3:  Open Microsoft Management Console (mmc.exe) to create and import the self-signed
          certificate
        </p>

        <p>
          Step 4:  Select File &gt; Add/Remove Snap-in. In the Add or Remove Snap-ins window, select
          Certificates, and click Add. Then select Computer account in the Certificates snap-in
          window.
        </p>

        <p>Step 5:  Click Next and select Local computer. Then, click Finish.</p>

        <p>
          Step 6:  The certificate will appear in the Selected snap-ins list in the Add or Remove
          Snap-ins window. Click OK to close the window.
        </p>

        <p>
          Step 7:  Navigate to Certificates &gt; Personal &gt; Certificates. The certificate should
          appear in the right pane.
        </p>

        <p>
          Step 8:  The self-signed certificate was created and imported. Repeat these steps for each
          client-side host.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are unable to access the Published Reports using SSL or SSO, check these items for
          potential issues:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>The certificate is bound to port 8082 </li>
          <li>The webserver.exe.config file is updated and is saved</li>
          <li>
            The correct StealthAUDIT Web Service was restarted in the Windows Services console
          </li>
          <li>The cache was cleared in Internet Explorer</li>
          <li>The Https site(s)/zone(s) are added to the Local Intranet Trusted Sites settings</li>
        </ol>

        <p>To add your site to the Trusted Zone:</p>

        <p>Step 1: In Internet Explorer, click the Settings icon, then select Internet Options</p>

        <p>Step 2:  Navigate to the Security Tab, click “Local intranet” and Select ‘Sites'</p>

        <p>Step 3:  On the Local intranet pop-up, click the “Advanced” button</p>

        <p>Step 4:  Enter the URL for the server/servers and select Add (examples shown below)</p>

        <p>
           <img
            alt="mceclip2.png"
            src="kA04u0000000IK2CAM_f976e979-c671-48a6-b330-e955d61a42c5.png"
          />
        </p>

        <p>
          Step 5:  If these steps do not resolve the issue, you can try restoring the default IE
          settings. To reset the settings, from within Internet Explorer, navigate to Settings, then
          select Internet Options. Then navigate to the Advanced tab and click the Reset button.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Setting up AIC for SSL and SSO</strong></p>

        <p>
          AIC relies on Microsoft’s IIS for most of its configurations whereas the web reports
          website relies on configuration files and webserver services to generate the site. It’s
          also important to note that for SSO to work properly with SSL, you will need the AIC
          application to be installed on the same server as the SA console, and both applications
          will need to use the same certificate.
        </p>

        <p>
          After AIC is installed and the web reports are configured for SSL and SSO, configure IIS
          by
        </p>

        <p>Step 1: Clicking on the Start menu and searching for the application ‘IIS’</p>

        <p>Step 2: Navigating to StealthAUDIT Compliance, under ‘Sites’, from within IIS</p>

        <p>Step 3: Selecting ‘Bindings’ in the Actions menu on the right pane</p>

        <p>
          Step 4: Selecting the option for https, and clicking Edit (the default port 481, but you
          can choose any port suited to your environment).
        </p>

        <p>Step 5: Selecting the SSL certificate used to configure Web Reports</p>

        <p>Below is an example of the configuration:</p>

        <p>
          <img
            alt="mceclip3.png"
            src="kA04u0000000IK2CAM_eca8178d-566e-4685-a455-a983b3fb87de.png"
          />
        </p>

        <p>
          Step 6: If you would like to limit the access to the AIC ONLY with SSL, then you can force
          this connection by selecting the SSL button with StealthAUDIT Compliance selected in the
          left hand pane shown below:
        </p>

        <p>
          <img
            alt="mceclip4.png"
            src="kA04u0000000IK2CAM_3c25d56f-5cfd-4cf8-9f61-49ba59d5222e.png"
          />
        </p>

        <p>Step 7: Click on the Require SSL checkbox, and click ‘Apply’ in the Actions pane:</p>

        <p>
          <img
            alt="mceclip5.png"
            src="kA04u0000000IK2CAM_df38703c-86d4-4e1c-9e1e-61494829c079.png"
          />
        </p>

        <p>Step 8: In File Explorer, navigate to the AIC working directory:</p>

        <p>C:\inetpub\wwwroot\StealthAUDIT Compliance</p>

        <p>
          Step 9: Open the file Web.config in notepad to edit the settings for
          AuthAllowWindowsAuthentication and AuthSessionValidationUrl
        </p>

        <p>Step 10: Edit the AuthAllowWindowsAuthentication setting by changing:</p>

        <p>the value to “True”</p>

        <p> Step 11:  Edit the AuthSessionValidationURL setting by changing:</p>

        <p>
          http://localhost:8082/whoami"/&gt; to value="<a
            href="https://localhost:8082/whoami"
            target="_blank"
            >https://localhost:8082/whoami</a
          >"
        </p>

        <p>
          It is recommended to rename the localhost to the FQDN URL of the Audit server. You can
          copy the value from the reports section of the audit console and paste in the URL.
        </p>

        <p>To complete the SSO procedure:</p>

        <p>
          Step 1: Go to IIS and click on the authentication icon for the StealthAUDIT compliance
          website:
        </p>

        <p>
          <img
            alt="mceclip6.png"

          />
        </p>

        <p>Step 2:  Choose “Disabled” for Anonymous Authentication</p>

        <p>Step 3: Choose “Enabled” for Windows Authentication</p>

        <p>
          <img
            alt="mceclip7.png"
            src="kA04u0000000IK2CAM_6fa30160-0baa-4835-94fc-e68fa334e9c2.png"
          />
        </p>

        <p>
          Step 4: Open file explorer and open the file web.config in the AIC working directory
          (C:\inetpub\wwwroot\StealthAUDIT Compliance) to modify the settings
        </p>

        <p>Step 5: Edit the Authentication mode by changing the setting:</p>

        <p>to</p>

        <p>
          Step 6: <em>(Skip this step for v11 and above)</em> Edit the “http customBindings” section
          by changing:
        </p>

        <p> </p>

        <p>
          Step 7: <em>(Skip this step for v11 and above)</em> Edit the “https customBindings”
          section by changing:
        </p>

        <p> </p>

        <p>Step 8: Save and close the web.config file</p>

        <p>
          Step 9: Open the Command Prompt as an administrator. (Search for ‘CMD’ on the start menu.
          When you find the application, right click, and select the option ‘Run as administrator’)
        </p>

        <p>
          Step 10: From the Command Prompt, as an administrator, restart IIS by running the command:
        </p>

        <p>iisreset /noforce</p>

        <p>
          Step 11: Open Internet Explorer and enable the “Windows Integrated Authentication”
          setting, which can be found on the Advanced Tab, after selecting Internet Options, shown
          below:
        </p>
