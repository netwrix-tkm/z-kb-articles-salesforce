For example, let's say your password is <b>PASSWORD</b>. If the tolerance is four, PPE will search the dictionary for these words:<br/><br/><b>PASSW<br/>ASSWO<br/>SSWOR<br/>SWORD<br/>PASSWO<br/>ASSWOR<br/>SSWORD<br/>PASSWOR<br/>ASSWORD<br/>PASSWORD</b><br/><br/>The start length is Tolerance + 1 characters. The rule may perform other searches depending on the settings (such as searching for all these words backwards if Bi-directional Analysis is enabled). In the example above, you can see that SWORD would have been found if it was in the dictionary file.<br/><br/>If the Tolerance were set to six, PPE would search the file for these words:<br/><br/><b>PASSWOR<br/>ASSWORD<br/>PASSWORD</b><br/><br/>Notice that there are fewer searches and so PPE is less likely to find a match (more tolerant). In this example, PASSWORD would still be matched. So increasing the tolerance makes PPE more tolerant of shorter matches in the file. It didn't find <b>SWORD</b>, but it still found <b>PASSWORD</b>.</div>
