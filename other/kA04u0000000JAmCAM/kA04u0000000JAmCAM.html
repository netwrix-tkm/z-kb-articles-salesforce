As part of an earlier enhancement to 7.1 a decision was made to automatically zip our report files that are set to be emailed by default. This was later changed to accommodate customer security requirements; as many customers are not able to send/receive zipped files as an email attachment. This hotfix introduces the zipping functionality as an optional checkbox, that includes the ability to set a threshold file size for when a report should be sent as a zipped file.</p><p><strong><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Issue:</span></strong> Modules: <br/><br/>- StealthAUDIT.EXE 7.1.526 <br/>- MigraDoc.DocumentObjectModel.dll 1.32.3885.0 <br/>- MigraDoc.Rendering.dll 1.32.3885.0 <br/>- MigraDoc.RtfRendering.dll 1.32.3885.0 <br/>- PdfSharp.dll 1.32.2608.0 <br/>- PdfSharp.Charting.dll 1.32.2608.0 <br/>- SAJobEngine 7.1.195 <br/>- Stealthbits.StealthAUDIT.Reporting.dll 7.1.88 <br/>- StealthAUDIT\Templates <br/><br/>YouTrack/Escalations <br/>- SMPC-1523 Add configurable option to determine whether to zip emailed report files. <br/><br/><br/>Cumulative List of fixes included since Service Pack: <br/><br/>RMT/YouTrack Description <br/>SMPC-11 StealthAUDIT Reporting: Make new Reporting engine to able to log debug statements. <br/>SMPC-117 Zip pdf file when email reports is turned on. <br/>SMPC-13 Reporting: Table name not recognized during report generation if the job contains a '.' in the name <br/>SMPC-191 SMP | Reporting | https report index links to http site <br/>SMPC-209 Reporting shows duplicate folders when &amp; symbol is in name <br/>SMPC-367 Blank email reports being sent regardless of settings. <br/>SMPC-398 Actions via right click menu displays old 6.3 Actions UI <br/>SMPC-403 Actions: Attempting to execute a cross-domain action during a job run fails <br/>SMPC-408 Job Properties: Remove Change Detection Tab <br/>SMPC-413 Reporting - export full data regardless of visual row limit. <br/>SMPC-449 Reporting PDF bar charts (non pie charts) <br/>smpc-476 Issue where 'showing xx row' count on bottom of report does not show proper count when element is grouped by a column <br/>SMPC-496 Creating jobs/queries leaves files behind in root of C: <br/>SMPC-511 CORE | Correction of Typos <br/>SMPC-514 Reporting: Add sending of zipped CSV data to the recipients. <br/>SMPC-535 Hosts that have an address that ends in .255 are not added to the database from IPSWEEP_QUERY <br/>SMPC-553 Blank Connection Profile Name <br/>SMPC-559 Core: Connection profile not available for selection on jobs <br/>SMPC-562 Core - Running Job with Bad Storage Profile does not identify errors.
